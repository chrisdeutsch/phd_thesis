\section{Discussion and outlook}%
\label{sec:result_discussion}

The results obtained as part of the searches for non-resonant SM \HH
production and resonant production via narrow width scalar bosons are
discussed in the following.

Both searches are largely limited by data statistical uncertainties
which represent the majority of the uncertainty on extracted signal
strengths or cross sections. Systematic uncertainties are
comparatively small for the search for non-resonant SM \HH production
and resonant production at intermediate to high masses. Only for the
search for low mass scalar resonances uncertainties from systematic
sources are comparable to data statistical uncertainties, however,
they do not solely limit the final result.

Thus the largest improvements are expected from increases in the
integrated luminosity expected for Run~3 of the LHC and beyond. The
prospects of searches for Higgs boson pairs for Run~4 (high luminosity
LHC) studied by the ATLAS collaboration
in~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2021-044,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2022-005} are briefly
discussed providing an outlook for future searches.

% and thus might not correspond to a net improvement of the results.

\subsection{Search for non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs}

The search presented in this work provides the most stringent expected
upper limits on the signal strength SM \HH production via \ggF and VBF
from direct searches of Higgs boson pair production. A summary of past
and present results by the ATLAS collaboration is given
in~\Cref{fig:atlas_run2_hh_results} and results from the analysis of
the Run~2 $pp$ dataset of the LHC by the CMS collaboration
in~\Cref{tab:cms_nonresonant}.

    the small cross section of VBF \HH production. Addtionally, the

    availability of improved theoretical predictions.  Note the
    different results for bbtautau. }

At the current stage, the $\bbbar\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel provides
large sensitivity to the non-resonant SM \HH production due to the .

The \bbtautau channel achieves a trade-off between the competing
$\bbbar\gamma\gamma$ and $\bbbar\bbbar$ channels. The
$\bbbar\gamma\gamma$ channel provides access to events with low \mHH
due the ability to trigger on the signature of photons with low
momentum thresholds and very high background rejection due to the
excellent $\gamma\gamma$ mass resolution, however, at the cost of very
small branching ratio. On the other hand, the $\bbbar\bbbar$ channel
provides the largest branching ratio of any final state resulting from
decays of Higgs boson pairs.

background / combinatorial issues with b-jet pairing)

production due to the

Why is bbtautau promising?
- SM HH production is sufficiently hard that taus become feasible.
- Larger branching ratio than bbyy
- Higher background rejection than 4b

The improvement in the analysis can be seen when performing an
approximate extrapolation of the ATLAS result with
\SI{36.1}{\per\femto\barn} integrated luminosity and an expected upper
limit on $\mu$, assuming that the result is limited by the data
statistical sources, to the integrated luminosity of the $pp$ dataset
at the end of Run~2. Extrapolating the expected upper limit to the
integrated luminosity of \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} yields a limit of
the signal strength of about 7
