The results obtained as part of the searches for non-resonant SM \HH
production and resonant production via narrow width scalar bosons are
discussed in the following.

Both searches are largely limited by data statistical uncertainties
which represent the majority of the uncertainty on extracted signal
strengths or cross sections. Systematic uncertainties are
comparatively small for the search for non-resonant SM \HH production
and resonant production at intermediate to high masses. Only for the
search for low mass scalar resonances uncertainties from systematic
sources are comparable to data statistical uncertainties, however,
they do not solely limit the final result.

The largest improvements are expected from increases in the integrated
luminosity expected for Run~3 of the LHC and beyond. The prospects of
searches for Higgs boson pairs for Run~4 (high luminosity LHC) studied
by the ATLAS collaboration
in~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2021-044,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2022-005} are briefly
discussed providing an outlook for future searches.

% and thus might not correspond to a net improvement of the results.

\subsection{Search for non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs}

The search presented in this work provides the most stringent expected
upper limits on the signal strength of SM \HH production via \ggF and
VBF for analysis targeting a single final state. This result is put
into context by summarising past and present results of direct SM \HH
searches by the ATLAS collaboration
in~\Cref{fig:atlas_run2_hh_results} and with the results of the CMS
collaboration in~\Cref{tab:cms_nonresonant} for analyses of the Run~2
dataset of $pp$-collisons.

With the currently available dataset and experimental constraints (due
to triggers, reconstruction, identification / isolation) of the ATLAS
experiment for Run~2 of the LHC, the \bbtautau channel achieves a
trade-off between the competing \bbyy and \bbbb channels regarding the
search for SM \HH production. While the \bbyy channel provides access
to events with low \mHH due to the ability to trigger on the signature
of photons with low momentum thresholds (this is particularly
advantageous when considering anomalous values of the Higgs boson
self-couplings, cf.~REFERENCE) and a large background rejection due to
the excellent $\gamma\gamma$ mass resolution, it is subject to the
very small $\PHiggs \to \gamma\gamma$ branching ratio. In contrast,
the largest fraction of SM \HH events are expected in the \bbbb final
state, however, the measurement of SM \HH production in this channel
is challenging due to the fully hadronic final state being subject to
large multi-jet backgrounds and difficulties in selecting signal
candidate events at trigger-level\footnote{There are also
  combinatorial difficulties in reconstructing $\PHiggs \to \bbbar$
  candidates in the \bbbb channel where it can be ambiguous
  (particularly at low \mHH) how $b$-jets are paired into Higgs boson
  candidates. However, SM \HH production is produced at sufficiently
  high \mHH such that this is not really a huge issue.}. The \bbtautau
final state, particulary in the \hadhad channel due to less prevalence
of \ttbar backgrounds compared to the \lephad channel, is very
sensitive to SM \HH production as signal events can be efficiently
selected using \tauhadvis triggers due to their hard \mHH
spectrum. The presence of \tauhadvis (and electrons / muons) provides
large rejection power against multi-jet backgrounds compared to the
\bbbb channel. Moreover, the fraction of SM \HH events decaying into
\bbtautau final states is significantly larger than that of \bbyy.

In~\Cref{fig:atlas_run2_36ifb,fig:atlas_run2_139ifb} a comparison
between searches for SM \HH production using the partial and full
Run~2 $pp$-collision dataset collected with the ATLAS detector is
given. The search for SM \HH production in the \bbtautau final state
using data collected at the beginning of Run~2 of the LHC
(\SI{36.1}{\per\femto\barn}) yielded an expected upper limit on
$\mu_{\ggF}$ of 14.8~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum}. While upper
limits are set on a different parameter and different theory cross
sections for the signal are assumed, the results can still be compared
to the one obtained using the full Run~2 $pp$-collision dataset
(\SI{139}{\per\femto\barn}) since the change cross section is small
and the contribution of the VBF production mode can be neglected for
the purpose of this comparison. The analysis of the full Run~2
$pp$-collision dataset presented in this work yields an expected upper
limit on $\mu_{\ggF+\text{VBF}}$ of 3.9, far exceeding the expectation
from a naive scaling of the previous result according to the increase
in integrated luminosity which would yield an expected upper limit of
about~7.\footnote{Assuming a purely statistically limited measurement
  that scales with integrated luminosity like a Poisson counting
  experiment. The change in the upper limit depends on the expected
  number of background events and thus cannot be soley described by
  the change in integrated luminosity. Depending on the scenario, the
  extrapolation of the upper limit of \num{14.8} from
  \SI{36.1}{\per\femto\barn} to \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} ranges
  between \num{6.5} and \num{7.5}.}  This improvement is primarily due
to two reasons:
\begin{itemize}

\item Large improvements in the signal acceptance due to improvements
  in $b$-tagging, \tauhadvis reconstruction and identification which
  allowed to relax identification requirements while maintaining
  background rates comparable to the previous analysis.

  The signal acceptance in the \hadhad channel improved by a factor of
  2 (1.2) in the \hadhad (\lephad) channel.

\item Increase in data (and available MC) allowing to select more
  extreme phase-spaces while mainting the limits of the re-binning
  algorithms. Thus yielding bins with higher signal sensitivity.
