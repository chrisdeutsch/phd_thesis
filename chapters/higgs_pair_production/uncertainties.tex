\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncertainties}

\subsection{Experimental Uncertainties}

\todo[inline]{Make this a 'description'?}

The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity of the $pp$ collision
dataset collected with the ATLAS detector in the period from 2015 to
2018 is \SI{1.7}{\percent}~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-021}. This
uncertainty is applied to all processes estimated using simulation
that are normalised using theory cross sections.

An uncertainty on the reweighting of the instantaneous luminosity
distribution used for the pile-up overlay in simulated data to match
the conditions observed in data is considered.

Uncertainties on electrons in simulation are obtained from dedicated
calibration measurements~\cite{EGAM-2018-01,TRIG-2018-05} updated for
the \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} Run~2 dataset. The electron energy scale
and resolution is measured in $Z \to e^+e^-$ events and propagated to
predictions by shifting and smearing momenta of electrons in
simulation. Uncertainties on the calibration of electron
reconstruction, identification, isolation, and trigger efficiencies in
simulation are obtained from measurements in~$J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ and
$Z \to e^+e^-$ events and applied as alternative weights to electrons
in simulation.

\subsection{Uncertainties on the relative acceptance of \ZHF and
  \ttbar between regions}

The normalisation of the \ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds are measured in
the combined likelihood fit of control and signal regions. Constraints
on the normalisation of the \ZHF background primarily originate from
the dedicated control region. The \ttbar background normalisation is
mainly constrained in the signal region of the \lephad SLT channel and
the \ZHF control region. Due to the determination of the normalisation
of these processes from the fit to data, any uncertainties on their
overall normalisation, for example uncertainties on the total cross
sections, are omitted. Uncertainties changing the relative acceptance
of \ZHF or \ttbar events between regions have to be considered
instead. These uncertainties will be referred to as \emph{relative
  acceptance uncertainties}, hereafter. The approach outlined in the
following was originally adopted by the previously published analysis
in this channel~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum} from searches and
measurements of $VH$~($H\to\bbbar$)
production~\cite{HIGG-2016-29,HIGG-2018-04,HIGG-2018-51}.

Assuming a general case of a background process that is estimated
using simulation and normalised by a fit to data in two analysis
regions A and B, with region A being defined as the reference
region. In this case, the probability of an event to be selected in a
given region~R is given by the product of acceptance and efficiency,
$(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{R}}$, for this region. The simulation predicts
how \AccTimesEff relates between both regions and one can define the
ratio
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{R} = \frac{(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{B}}}{(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{A}}} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
which will be be referred to as the \emph{relative acceptance} between
regions A and B. Uncertainties on the modelling of $\mathcal{R}$ in
simulation are assigned as uncertainties on the normalisation of the
background process in region B\todo{Show mathematically?}. They are
estimated by performing variations of the background prediction, for
example using alternative generator configurations, and estimating a
relative change of~$\mathcal{R}$ according to
\begin{align}
  \frac{\Delta \mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}} = \frac{\mathcal{R}(\text{variation}) - \mathcal{R}(\text{nominal})}{\mathcal{R}(\text{nominal})} \,\text{.}
  \label{eq:relative_acceptance_uncertainty}
\end{align}
The relative acceptance is used to define the uncertainties due to the
cancellation effects of variations leading to the same relative change
in \AccTimesEff in both regions, which corresponds to an overall
change in normalisation and can be absorbed in the normalisation
factor of the process.

The relative acceptance uncertainties are defined using the \ZHF
control region as a reference, which provides good constraints on both
the \ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds. The uncertainties are derived for
both backgrounds and in all three signal regions separately and are
assigned as normalisation uncertianties on \ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds
in the signal regions.

% This uncertainty on the relative acceptance between the the
% reference region A and region B is included in the background model
% by assigning a normalisation uncertainty of
% $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ on the background in region B.

% The absolute value\footnote{When introducing multiple regions, the
% relative sign of $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ when comparing
% different regions to the same reference is important when
% correlating these uncertainties in the statistical analysis and is
% kept to allow to consistently define the variations.} of
% $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ is considered the extrapolation
% uncertainty.

% The shape effects of uncertainties are estimated separately and will be described in~\Cref{sec:modelling_uncertainties}.

% Note: Sign is important -> direction of effect when correlating systematics

The relative acceptance uncertainties are estimated separately for the
\ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds for all three signal regions (\hadhad,
\lephad SLT, \lephad LTT) with respect to the \ZHF control
region. Uncertainties originating from the same source are assumed to
be fully correlated.

The following variations of the modelling of the \ZHF using simulation
are considered. The approach follows prescriptions developed by the
ATLAS collaboration:
\begin{description}
\item[Factorisation and renormalisation scales] Six variations of the
factorisation and renormalisation scales are performed using
  internal reweighting implemented in \SHERPA[2.2.1], altering the
  scales by factors of $\frac{1}{2}$ and $2$. The following variations
  are considered:
  \begin{align*}
    \left( \frac{\muF}{\muF^{\text{nom.}}}, \frac{\muR}{\muR^{\text{nom.}}} \right) \in
    \left\{ (\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}), (\tfrac{1}{2}, 1), (1, \tfrac{1}{2}), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2) \right\} \,\text{,}
  \end{align*}
  where $\muF^{\text{nom.}}$ and $\muR^{\text{nom.}}$ are the nominal
  values of the scales.

\item[Resummation scale] The resummation scale \todo{more explanation}
  is varied by factors $\frac{1}{2}$ and 2. The variation is provided
  as a reweighting of event weights by the
  collaboration~\cite{anders:2017} and is parametrised in the
  transverse momentum of the \PZ boson and the number of jets
  (anti-$k_{t}$ $R = 0.4$ with $\pT > \SI{20}{\GeV}$) at truth-level.

\item[Multi-jet merging] The \Vjets samples produced with
  \SHERPA[2.2.1] uses matrix elements of NLO accuracy for up to two
  jets and LO for up to four jets. The different jet multiplicities
  are merged using an extended CKKW
  algorithm~\cite{Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}. The merging
  scale\footnote{What does it mean?}, which is a parameter of the
  algorithm, is varied from \SI{20}{\GeV} to \SI{30}{\GeV} and
  \SI{15}{\GeV}, respectively.

  The variations of the merging scale are also provided as weights to
  be applied to the nominal event generation following the approach
  for variations of the resummation scale.

\item[PDF+\alphas] Uncertainties on the \NNPDF[3.0nnlo] set of
  PDFs~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} are evaluated using 100 replica sets
  provided through the \textsc{LHAPDF6}
  library~\cite{Buckley:2014ana}. Similarly, the \NNPDF[3.0nnlo] PDF
  sets with $\alphas(Q^2=\mZ^2) = 0.117$ and $0.119$ are compared to
  the nominal value of $0.118$. Finally, an uncertainty from the
  choice of PDF set is considered by comparing with two alternative
  PDF sets, \MMHT[nnlo68cl]~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} and
  \CT[14nnlo]~\cite{Dulat:2015mca}.

\item[Alternative generator and parton shower] The nominal prediction
  obtained with \SHERPA[2.2.1] (\OPENLOOPS and Comix) is compared to
  an alternative setup using~\MGNLO[2.2.2]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} for
  the calculation of LO matrix elements interfaced
  to~\PYTHIA[8.186]~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} for parton showering.

\end{description}
These variations are used to estimate the relative acceptance
uncertainties for the \ZHF background according to
\Cref{eq:relative_acceptance_uncertainty} and are summarised in
