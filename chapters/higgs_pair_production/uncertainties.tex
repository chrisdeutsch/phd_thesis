\section{Systematic Uncertainties}%
\label{sec:uncertainties}

The systematic uncertainties affecting the search for non-resonant and resonant
Higgs boson pair production are discussed in the following. Experimental
uncertainties are described in \Cref{sec:experimental_uncertainties} but exclude
uncertainties related to the estimation of \faketauhadvis backgrounds in the
\hadhad channel. These were previously described
in~\Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ttbarfakes,sec:bkg_hadhad_ff}. Theory uncertainties are
described in~\Cref{sec:theory_uncertainties} and include uncertainties on the
modelling of physics processes using MC simulations.

The searches for Higgs boson pair production presented in this thesis are
generally limited by statistical uncertainties due to the finite number of
events observed in the SRs. Theory uncertainties play a lesser role and
instrumental uncertainties are only relevant for searches for scalar resonance
with low masses ($\mX \lesssim \SI{300}{\GeV}$). The impact of statistical and
systematic uncertainties on the results are discussed in the context of the
statistical interpretation in \Cref{sec:statistical_analysis}.


\subsection{Experimental Uncertainties}%
\label{sec:experimental_uncertainties}

Experimental uncertainties arise from the measurement of the integrated
luminosity, the re-weighting of the pile-up conditions in simulation, the
reconstruction of physics objects, and the efficiencies of selections applied to
these objects. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental uncertainties apply to
signal and background processes estimated using simulation.

The integrated luminosity of the \pp-collision dataset recorded with the ATLAS
detector during Run~2 of the LHC is measured with an uncertainty of
\SI{1.7}{\percent}~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-021}. This uncertainty is applied to
all processes normalised using theoretical cross section predictions. Moreover,
an uncertainty is assigned on the re-weighting of the simulated event samples to
match the pile-up conditions in the recorded \pp-collision
dataset. Uncertainties related to the reconstruction and selection of physics
objects are provided by dedicated calibration measurements performed by the
ATLAS collaboration. In this search, these calibrations are used for
electrons~\cite{EGAM-2018-01,TRIG-2018-05}, muons~\cite{MUON-2018-03},
\tauhadvis~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2017-029}, jets~\cite{JETM-2018-05},
flavour-tagging~\cite{FTAG-2018-01,FTAG-2020-08,FTAG-2021-002}, and the
\pTmissAbs reconstruction~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-023}. These measurements yield
uncertainties on the momentum scale, momentum resolution, and selection
efficiencies of reconstructed objects. The major categories of instrumental
uncertainties are summarised in
\Cref{tab:experimental_uncertainties_2}. Uncertainties on the selection
efficiencies of electron, muon, and \tauhadvis triggers are only considered in
channels where these triggers are used. All uncertainties affecting the
four-momentum of reconstructed and selected objects are also propagated to the
object-based \pTmissAbs reconstruction.
% Additional calibrations and uncertainties are derived for event samples using
% fast simulation of the ATLAS detector.

% Except for the luminosity uncertainty, any of the previously mentioned
% uncertainties can affect the shape and/or normalisation of the distributions
% used in the statistical interpretation. Therefore, both the shape and
% normalisation effects of these uncertainties are propagated to the relevant
% distributions.

    describing the uncertainty is given in the right-most column.}%

  { \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \input{tables/detector_uncertainties} }
\end{table}

Experimental uncertainties on the \faketauhadvis background estimates in the
\lephad channels account for the statistical uncertainties of the \FFqcd,
\FFttbar, and \rqcd estimates. Moreover, uncertainties on the subtraction of
\ttbar and non-\ttbar processes in the combined FF method are taken into
account. An additional uncertainty is assigned on \rqcd due to it being derived
using a simulation-based estimate of the \ttbarFakes contribution in the \antiid
region. In the \lephad SLT and LTT channel the total uncertainty on the
normalisation of the \faketauhadvis background are
$^{\hspace{0.25pt}+\hspace{0.25pt}18\,\%}_{-23\,\%}$ and
$^{\hspace{0.25pt}+\hspace{0.25pt}28\,\%}_{-30\,\%}$, respectively. The effect
of these uncertainties on the shape of the final discriminants are considered in
the background model.

% The leading contributions to these uncertainties are the \ttbar subtraction
% and variations of \rqcd in the SLT channel and the \ttbar and non-\ttbar
% subtraction, variations of \rqcd, and the statistical precision of \FFttbar in
% the LTT channel. The effect of these variations on the shape of final
% discriminants are considered in the background model.


\subsection{Theory Uncertainties}%
\label{sec:modelling_uncertainties}%
\label{sec:theory_uncertainties}

A number of theoretical uncertainties need to be considered for signal and
background processes estimated using simulation. For a given process these
uncertainties are split, where applicable, into uncertainties on the cross
section and uncertainties on the acceptance due to analysis
selections. Generally, acceptance uncertainties for a given signal or background
process are assumed to be correlated across regions if the uncertainty
originates from the same source.

The description of the theory uncertainties is structured as follows: First, the
uncertainties on the major \ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds are described. Second,
uncertainties on minor background processes are estimated. Lastly, uncertainties
on the modelling of the signal processes are presented.


\subsubsection{Acceptance Uncertainties on \ZHF and \ttbar Backgrounds}

The normalisation of the \ZHF and \ttbar backgrounds are measured in the
simultaneous fit to the observed data in all regions. Constraints on the
normalisation of the \ZHF background can be obtained from the
\ZHF~CR. Similarly, the \ttbar normalisation can be constrained in the SR of the
\lephad SLT channel and the \ZHF~CR. Since the normalisation of these processes
is determined in the fit to data, any uncertainties on the normalisation of
these processes (e.g.~cross section uncertainties) are omitted. Instead,
uncertainties on the relative acceptance of \ZHF and \ttbar between analysis
regions have to be considered. These uncertainties are hereafter referred to as
\emph{relative acceptance uncertainties}.
% The approach outlined below was originally adopted by the previous search
% performed in this channel~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum} from searches and
% measurements of $VH$~($H\to\bbbar$)
% production~\cite{HIGG-2016-29,HIGG-2018-04,HIGG-2018-51}.

The derivation of relative acceptance uncertainties is described using an
example of a background that is estimated using simulation and normalised by a
fit to data in two regions~A and~B, with region~A being declared as the
\emph{reference region}. The probability of an event being selected into
region~R is given by the product of acceptance and efficiency,
$(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{R}}$, for this region. The simulation of the background
process predicts how \AccTimesEff relates between regions and one can define the
ratio
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{R} = \frac{(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{B}}}{(\AccTimesEff)_{\text{A}}} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
which will be be referred to as the \emph{relative acceptance} between regions~A
and~B. Uncertainties on the modelling of $\mathcal{R}$ in simulation are
assigned as uncertainties on the normalisation of the background process in
region~B and no additional uncertainties are assigned in the reference
region. Uncertainties on $\mathcal{R}$ are estimated by performing variations of
the simulation and estimating a relative change in $\mathcal{R}$ according to
\begin{align}
  \frac{\Delta \mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}} = \frac{\mathcal{R}(\text{variation}) - \mathcal{R}(\text{nominal})}{\mathcal{R}(\text{nominal})} \,\text{,}
  \label{eq:relative_acceptance_uncertainty}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{R}(\text{nominal})$ and $\mathcal{R}(\text{variation})$ is the
relative acceptance predicted by the nominal and varied simulation setup,
respectively. Using relative acceptances to define modelling uncertainties leads
to cancellations of variations that lead to the same relative change in
\AccTimesEff in both regions. This corresponds to an overall change in
normalisation of the process in both regions that can be absorbed in the free
normalisation factor.

% This uncertainty on the relative acceptance between the the
% reference region A and region B is included in the background model
% by assigning a normalisation uncertainty of
% $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ on the background in region B.

% The absolute value\footnote{When introducing multiple regions, the
% relative sign of $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ when comparing
% different regions to the same reference is important when
% correlating these uncertainties in the statistical analysis and is
% kept to allow to consistently define the variations.} of
% $\Delta \mathcal{R} / \mathcal{R}$ is considered the extrapolation
% uncertainty.

% The shape effects of uncertainties are estimated separately and will be described in~\Cref{sec:modelling_uncertainties}.

Relative acceptance uncertainties are defined for the \ZHF and \ttbar
backgrounds using the \ZHF~CR as a reference region. The uncertainties are
estimated separately for the SRs of the \hadhad, \lephad SLT, and \lephad LTT
channel.

For the \ZHF background, the uncertainties are derived by performing variations
of the simulation setup following recommendations by the ATLAS collaboration,
which are summarised in \Cref{app:zjets_uncertainties}. The following aspects of
the simulation are varied: the matrix element generator and parton shower
program, the factorisation and renormalisation scales, the resummation scale,
the multi-jet merging scale, the PDFs and \alphas, and the PDF set. The relative
acceptance uncertainties on the \ZHF background are summarised
in~\Cref{tab:uncertainties_zhf_extrapol} for the three SRs.

A similar approach is taken for the \ttbar background. Variations of the
simulation setup are performed according to prescriptions developed by the ATLAS
collaboration (cf.~\Cref{app:top_uncertainties}). The following elements of the
simulation setup are varied: the matrix element generator, the simulation of the
parton shower and hadronisation, the factorisation and renormalisation scales,
the simulation of initial- and final-state radiation, the PDFs and \alphas. The
relative acceptance uncertainties resulting from these prescriptions are
summarised in~\Cref{tab:uncertainties_ttbar_extrapol}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering

  \caption{Relative acceptance uncertainties on the \ZHF (a) and \ttbar (b)
    background in the three SRs. All uncertainties are estimated using the
    \ZHF~CR as the reference region. The relative sign of the effect of
    variations is indicated by the $\pm$ and $\mp$ prefixes. The total
    uncertainty is given for illustration purposes only.}

    \input{tables/uncertainties_ttbar_extrapol}
  \end{subtable}
\end{table}

Relative acceptance uncertainties are implemented as uncertainties on the
normalisation of backgrounds in the SRs. Variations of the modelling in
simulation can also change the shapes of discriminants used for signal
extraction, including $\mll$ in the \ZHF CR, which need to be
considered. Therefore, the impact of modelling uncertainties on the
distributions of the MVA discriminants in the SRs and the \mll distribution in
the \ZHF~CR are investigated. In cases where the shapes do not differ
significantly, no additional uncertainties are assigned. When deviations are
observed, the shape uncertainties are propagated to the discriminants and
correlated with the corresponding normalisation uncertainties.

Shape uncertainties on the \ZHF background are considered for the variation of
the matrix element generator and parton shower program (\hadhad channel), and
for variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales (\hadhad and
\lephad SLT/LTT channels). All other variations are found to have negligible
impact on thes hape of the discriminating variables, including \mll in the
\ZHF~CR.

Shape uncertainties on the \ttbar background are considered for the comparison
with an alternative matrix element generator and parton shower program (\hadhad
and \lephad SLT channels), and the uncertainty on the modelling of initial- and
final-state radiation (\hadhad channel). All other variations have negligible
impact on the shapes of the relevant distributions.


\subsubsection{Uncertainties on Minor Backgrounds}

The minor backgrounds considered in the analysis are normalised using
theoretical cross sections predictions and thus both cross section and
acceptance uncertainties are considered. Except for the $tW$~acceptance
uncertainties, only uncertainties on the normalisation of minor backgrounds are
considered. A brief description of the uncertainties on minor backgrounds is
given in the following:
\begin{description}

\item[\PZ + LF] A normalisation uncertainty of \SI{5}{\percent} is assigned to
  account for the uncertainty on the predicted cross section of \Zjets
  production at NNLO~\cite{Anastasiou:2003ds}. Additionally, an acceptance
  uncertainty of \SI{23}{\percent} is adopted from Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2018-51}.

\item[\PW + jets] A \SI{5}{\percent} cross section uncertainty is assigned to
  the NNLO cross section prediction~\cite{Anastasiou:2003ds}. A normalisation
  uncertainty of \SI{37}{\percent} is assigned in the \lephad channels, which is
  adopted from Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2018-51}. This uncertainty is inflated to
  \SI{50}{\percent} in the \hadhad channel since the small \Wjets contribution
  is not part of the data-driven \faketauhadvis estimation.

\item[Diboson] Normalisation uncertainties of \SI{20}{\percent},
  \SI{26}{\percent}, and \SI{25}{\percent} are applied to $ZZ$, $WZ$, and $WW$
  production, respectively. These uncertainties are adopted from
  Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2018-51}.

\item[Single top] Uncertainties on the cross section used to normalise the
  predictions are taken from Ref.~\cite{stopxsec}. A \SI{20}{\percent}
  acceptance uncertainty is assigned to the minor contribution of single top
  produced via $s$- and $t$-channel diagrams, which is adopted from
  Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2018-51}.

  Acceptance uncertainties in the phase space selected by the analysis are
  derived for $tW$~production, which is the dominant source of single top
  background in this analysis. The acceptance uncertainties on the NLO+PS
  matching and the choice of parton shower program are estimated by comparison
  with alternative simulation setups using \MGNLO[2.6.2] and \HERWIG[7],
  respectively. Uncertainties on PDF+\alphas and the simulation of initial- and
  final-state radiation are obtained by re-weighting of the nominal simulation
  result. Finally, an uncertainty on the treatment of the interference between
  $tW$ at NLO and \ttbar production is estimated by performing MC-to-MC
  comparisons of the nominal \emph{diagram removal} and \emph{diagram
    subtraction} schemes~\cite{Frixione:2008yi}.

  The total acceptance uncertainty on $tW$~production is \SI{34}{\percent} in
  the \hadhad~channel, \SI{14}{\percent} in the \lephad~SLT channel, and
  \SI{23}{\percent} in the \lephad~LTT channel. Shape effects of the FSR and
  $tW$-$\ttbar$ interference uncertainties on the MVA discriminants are taken
  into account in the background model.

\item[Single SM~$H$] Uncertainties on the total cross section of the SM $H$
  production modes considered as backgrounds are assigned according to the
  recommendations in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz} for
  $m_{H} = \SI{125.0}{\GeV}$. Analogously, uncertainties on the branching ratios
  of $\PHiggs \to \tautau$ and $\PHiggs \to \bbbar$ are assigned to the relevant
  processes and are taken from Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

  An acceptance uncertainty of \SI{100}{\percent} is assigned to $H \to \tautau$
  backgrounds produced via \ggF, VBF, and $WH$ to account for difficulties in
  the modelling of associated production of SM~$H$ with heavy flavour
  quarks. This uncertainty is a convention adopted by the ATLAS collaboration
  for searches for Higgs boson pair production using the Run~2 \pp-collision
  dataset.

  Acceptance uncertainties in the phase space selected by the analysis are
  derived for single Higgs boson backgrounds produced via $ZH$, $\ttbar H$ for
  both $H \to \tautau$ and $H \to \bbbar$. They are derived by varying the
  parton shower program, the factorisation and renormalisation scale, the PDF
  and \alphas. Additionally for $\ttbar H$ production, uncertainties on the
  NLO+PS matching and the modelling of initial- and final-state radiation are
  assigned.

\subsubsection{Signal Modelling Uncertainties: SM $HH$}

% CROSS SECTION
Uncertainties on the predicted SM~\HH production cross section are taken into
account when the signal strength is the POI of the statistical
analysis. However, when the SM~\HH production cross section is the POI, cross
section uncertainties on the signal processes are omitted.

The theoretical cross section prediction for SM~\HH production via \ggF at
NNLO~\FTapprox~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd} has an uncertainty
of~$^{\hspace{0.25pt}+\hspace{0.25pt}\phantom{2}6}_{-23}\valuesep\si{\percent}$
from scale variations and the treatment of the finite top quark
mass~\cite{Baglio:2020wgt}, and an uncertainty of~\SI{\pm 3.0}{\percent} from
variations of PDF+\alphas~\cite{LHCHWGHH}. The cross section prediction for
SM~\HH production via VBF at N$^3$LO~\cite{Dreyer:2018qbw} has an uncertainty
of~$^{\hspace{0.25pt}+\hspace{0.25pt}0.03}_{-0.04}\valuesep\si{\percent}$ from
scale variations~\cite{LHCHWGHH} and \SI{\pm 2.1}{\percent} from variations of
PDF+\alphas~\cite{LHCHWGHH}.

Uncertainties on the branching ratios of $H \to \tautau$ and $H \to \bbbar$ are
taken from Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz} and assigned as uncertainties on the
signal normalisation.

Signal acceptance uncertainties are derived in all regions by performing
variations of the signal prediction.
% The variations are ensured to leave the total cross section
% invariant to prevent double-counting of cross section uncertainties.
The uncertainty on the choice of the parton shower program is estimated by
comparing the nominal signal generation using \PYTHIA[8.244] for parton
showering with an alternative using \HERWIG[7.1.6]. An uncertainty from the
effect of missing higher orders in the perturbative expansion is estimated by
performing six variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales using
internal re-weighting of the generator. Uncertainties on the PDF sets are
estimated using the prescriptions for the
\PDFforLHC[15nlo]~\cite{Butterworth:2015oua} and
\NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF sets for \ggF and VBF, respectively. The
PDF uncertainties are provided in the form of 30 eigenvariations for
\PDFforLHC[15nlo] and 100 replica sets for \NNPDF[3.0nlo]. Finally, the value of
$\alphas(\mZ^2)$ is varied up and down by 0.0015 (0.001) about the central value
of $0.118$ in the \PDFforLHC[15nlo] (\NNPDF[3.0nlo]) PDF set.

% The \PDF4LHC[15nlo] prescription uses 30
% eigenvariations of the PDF set that are independently propagated to
% the observables and the deviations from the nominal value are added in
% quadrature to yield the uncertainty. For \NNPDF[3.0nlo] PDF set which
% provides uncertainties in the form of MC replicas, the uncertainty is
% defined by the sample standard deviation of the observable determined
% using 100 replicas of the PDF set.

The acceptance uncertainties on the SM $HH$ signal are summarised
in~\Cref{tab:theory_uncertainty_signal} for the considered production modes. The
uncertainties on PDF+\alphas are found to be negligible in most cases and thus
omitted. The impact of the variations on the shape of the MVA discriminants is
found to be negligible in most cases. The variations of the factorisation and
renormalisation scales for the VBF production mode in the \hadhad SR is found to
induce small changes in the shape (up to \SI{2}{\percent} in bins sensitive to
the SM $HH$ signal) of the SM $HH$ BDT score distribution which is implemented
as a shape uncertainty for later statistical evaluation.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering

  \caption{Theory uncertainties on the acceptance of events from SM~$HH$
    production via \ggF and VBF in the three SRs. Uncertainties marked as ``--''
    are found to be negligible.}%
  \label{tab:theory_uncertainty_signal}

  \input{tables/theory_uncertainty_signal}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Signal Modelling Uncertainties: BSM $gg \to X \to HH$}

Cross section uncertainties are not considered for the production of heavy
scalar resonances in BSM scenarios since the cross
section~$\sigma(gg \to X \to HH)$ is used as the POI. However, uncertainties on
the SM Higgs boson branching ratios are considered according to
Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

Acceptance uncertainties on BSM \HH production are estimated for the choice of
parton shower program, factorisation and renormalisation scales, and
PDF+\alphas. The uncertainties are calculated for a subset of resonance masses
considered in the analysis (due to the availability of alternative samples) and
are subsequently extrapolated to the full set.

The acceptance uncertainty from the choice of parton shower program is estimated
by replacing the default configuration using \HERWIG[7.1.3] with \PYTHIA[8.235]
for signals with six different resonance masses:
\begin{align*}
  \mX / \si{\GeV} \in \left\{ 251, 260, 280, 400, 500, 1000
  \right\} \,\text{.}
\end{align*}
The uncertainty is estimated by comparing the acceptance of signal-like events,
which for this purpose are defined as all events exceeding the
15\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the PNN score distribution for the default
signal generation setup, between both parton shower programs. This approach is
taken due to large changes in acceptance of (background-like) signal events at
low PNN score to which this search is not sensitive, thus avoiding an inflation
of the parton shower uncertainty at high PNN score which the analysis can be
sensitive to. The uncertainties evaluated at six points of \mX are linearly
interpolated and extrapolated ($\mX > \SI{1000}{\GeV}$) in \mX to estimate
uncertainties for signal masses for which no alternative samples were produced.

\Cref{fig:resonant_partonshower} illustrates the acceptance uncertainty
estimated from the comparison of parton shower programs. The alternative
configuration using \PYTHIA for parton showering predicts acceptances that are
slightly larger than the nominal configuration for the \hadhad and \lephad SLT
channels at low resonance masses. For $\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$ \HERWIG predicts
larger signal acceptances in all three channels. The linear extrapolation in \mX
to the largest resonance mass of \SI{1600}{\GeV} that is considered leads to
acceptance uncertainties ranging from \SIrange{16}{19}{\percent}.

% \end{table}

  \caption{Acceptance uncertainty on the BSM production of $gg \to X \to HH$ in

    program. A positive sign of the uncertainty indicates that the alternative
    configuration (\PYTHIA) predicts a larger \AccTimesEff than the nominal one
    (\HERWIG) and vice versa for negatively signed uncertainties. The lines
    indicate the linear inter- / extrapolation in \mX used to obtain the
    uncertainties for all other points of \mX considered in the analysis (hollow
    markers).}
  \label{fig:resonant_partonshower}
\end{figure}

Acceptance uncertainties from factorisation and renormalisation scales, and
PDF+\alphas are evaluated at generator-level for two mass points with
$\mX = \SI{500}{\GeV}$ and \SI{1000}{\GeV} after approximating the selections
applied in the analysis. The uncertainties are found to be negligible and are
therefore omitted.

An additional uncertainty is assigned in the \hadhad and \lephad LTT channels to
signal samples using fast simulation with
\textsc{ATLFAST-II}~\cite{SOFT-2010-01}. The efficiency of \tauhadvis triggers
is found to deviate between full and fast simulation, without dedicated
calibrations of \tauhadvis trigger efficiencies in fast simulation being
available. An uncertainty is estimated by comparing the acceptance between full
and fast simulation for a benchmark sample at a mass of \SI{400}{\GeV}. The
acceptance predicted using fast simulation is \SI{6.5}{\percent}
(\SI{3.6}{\percent}) larger than in full simulation for the \hadhad (\lephad
LTT) SR for the benchmark point. Distributions of kinematic and MVA input
variables are compared between fast and full simulation showing no significant
deviations in their shapes. Therefore, the difference in acceptance is assigned
as an additional normalisation uncertainty in the \hadhad and \lephad LTT
channel for all signal samples simulated using \textsc{ATLFAST-II}~(i.e.\
$\mX \leq \SI{1000}{\GeV}$).
