\section{Background Estimation}

The dominant backgrounds in this analysis are \ttbar, \Zjets\todo{In
  particular Ztautau + HF} and backgrounds containing \faketauhad that
predominately originate from multi-jet, \Wjets, and \ttbar
processes. Minor contributions arise from \Wjets, single-\Ptop,
$\ttbar+\PVB$, diboson (\WW, \WZ, \ZZ), and processes containing a
single Higgs boson decaying into $\APtauon\Ptauon$ (\ggF, VBF, \VH,
\ttH) and \bbbar (\VH, \ttH).

The regions (SLT and \ZHF CR) entering the fit provide the ability to
constrain the normalisation of the \ttbar and \ZHF backgrounds with
sufficient precision. The \ZHF control region provides constraints on
\ZHF as well as \ttbar, while the \lephad SLT signal region provides
constraints on \ttbar. Therefore, the templates of these backgrouds
are estimated using simulation with the overall normalisation being
left free in the likelihood fit such that it can be extracted from
data.

Major backgrounds containing at least one \faketauhad are estimated
using data-driven methods. In the \lephad channel the contribution
\faketauhad from multi-jet, \Wjets, and \ttbar processes is estimated
jointly using a \textit{Combined Fake Factor method} which is
described in~\Cref{sec:bkg_lephad_combined_ff}. In the \hadhad
channel, the estimation is separated into \faketauhad originating from
multi-jet processes and \faketauhad in \ttbar. The multi-jet
contribution, where both reconstructed \tauhadvis are faked, is
estimated using a fully data-driven \textit{Fake Factor method} in
\Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ff}. In contrast, for \ttbar with \faketauhad the
\hadhad channel the number of \faketauhad can be either 1 or 2. Due to
the absence of a good \ttbar control region the \faketauhad background
in \ttbar is estimated using simulation after correcting the
misidentification efficiencies measured in a dedicated control region.

The minor background contributions are estimated using Monte Carlo
simulation normalised to the integrated luminosity of data using the
highest order inclusive cross-section predictions available.

\todo[inline]{Validation regions? Do we use any? Maybe 2-tag SS}

\todo[inline]{\ttbar split in TT, TF,FT, FF; no such distinction for b's since
  there is a small contribution of mis-tagged b's in the SR}

\todo[inline]{Small yields in hadhad: use lephad as top CR for TT and
  TF/FT and dedicated Z-CR; overall larger yields due to dropping of
  tauhad branching ratio and higher reconstruction and ID efficiency
  for electrons and muons}

\todo[inline]{Extrapolation uncertainty: Replacing \tauhad with electrons /
  muons changes event kinematics and selection efficiency which needs to be
  accounted for.}

\todo[inline]{Discuss the lack of pure validation regions particularly
  for \ttbar fakes.}
