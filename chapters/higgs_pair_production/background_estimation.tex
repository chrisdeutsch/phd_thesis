\section{Background Estimation}%
\label{sec:background_estimation}

The dominant background processes for the search for Higgs boson pair
production in the $\bbtautau$ final state are \ttbar, \Zjets, and
backgrounds with quark- or gluon-initiated jets that are misidentified
as \tauhadvis (\faketauhadvis backgrounds).
% Backgrounds with \faketauhadvis primarily originate from multi-jet,
% \Wjets, and \ttbar processes.
Minor backgrounds originate from single-top, $\ttbar V$,
diboson, and single Higgs boson production.  The single Higgs boson
production modes considered in this search are \ggF, VBF, \VH and \ttH
for $H \to \tautau$; $\VH$ and $\ttH$ for $H \to \bbbar$.
% While single Higgs boson production is classified as a minor
% background here, it has relevance to the extraction of \HH signals
% due to their similar signatures.

The \Zjets and \ttbar backgrounds are estimated using templates
obtained from simulation with their normalisations being determined in
a simultaneous likelihood fit to observed data in signal and control
regions. A control region enriched in $Z$ boson production in
association with jets from quarks of heavy flavour (\ZHF) is defined
in \Cref{sec:bkg_zjets} providing constraints on the normalisation of
this background. The normalisation of the \ttbar background is
constrained by the inclusion of the signal region of the \lephad SLT
channel and the \ZHF CR, both having a significant contribution of
events from \ttbar, in the simultaneous fit.
% The signal region of the \lephad SLT channel serves to constrain the
% normalisation of the \ttbar background as it selects \ttbar with
% high purity.

Major \faketauhadvis backgrounds are estimated using
(semi-)data-driven methods while minor ones are estimated using
simulation. In the \hadhad channel, the primary sources of
\faketauhadvis are \ttbar and multi-jet production for which separate
estimation techniques are used. The \faketauhadvis background from
\ttbar (\ttbarFakes) is estimated using simulation after applying
corrections of the \jettotauhadvis misidentification efficiencies
measured using data in a top control region. This method is described
in \Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ttbarfakes}.  The multi-jet background is
estimated using a fully data-driven \emph{fake factor method} that is
introduced in \Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ff}. The estimation of the
\faketauhadvis backgrounds in the \lephad channels uses a
\emph{combined fake factor method} that yields a combined estimate of
\faketauhadvis backgrounds from multi-jet, \Wjets, and \ttbar
processes. This method is briefly summarised
in~\Cref{sec:bkg_lephad_combined_ff}.

Minor background contributions are estimated using simulation and are
normalised to the integrated luminosity of the \pp-collision dataset
using the highest order cross-section predictions available. These
backgrounds are not discussed in detail in this section, however,
theoretical uncertainties from the modelling of these processes using
simulation are discussed at a later stage in
\Cref{sec:modelling_uncertainties}.
