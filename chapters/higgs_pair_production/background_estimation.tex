\section{Background Estimation}%
\label{sec:background_estimation}

The dominant background processes in the search for Higgs boson pair production
in $\bbtautau$ final states are \Zjets, \ttbar, and backgrounds with quark- or
gluon-initiated jets that are misidentified as \tauhadvis (\faketauhadvis
backgrounds).
% Backgrounds with \faketauhadvis primarily originate from multi-jet, \Wjets,
% and \ttbar processes.
Minor backgrounds originate from single-top, $\ttbar V$, diboson, and single
Higgs boson production.  The single Higgs boson production modes considered in
this search are \ggF, VBF, \VH and \ttH for $H \to \tautau$; $\VH$ and $\ttH$
for $H \to \bbbar$. Single Higgs boson production via $\bbbar H$ is found to be
negligible.
% While single Higgs boson production is classified as a minor background here,
% it has relevance to the extraction of \HH signals due to their similar
% signatures.

The \Zjets and \ttbar backgrounds are estimated using templates obtained from
simulation with their normalisations being determined in a simultaneous
likelihood fit to observed data in SRs and CRs. A CR enriched in $Z$~boson
production in association with jets from quarks of heavy flavour (\ZHF) is
defined in \Cref{sec:bkg_zjets} providing constraints on the normalisation of
this background. The normalisation of the \ttbar background is constrained by
the inclusion of the SR of the \lephad SLT channel and the \ZHF CR in the
simultaneous fit, both having a measurable contribution of events from \ttbar
production.
% The signal region of the \lephad SLT channel serves to constrain the
% normalisation of the \ttbar background as it selects \ttbar with high purity.

Major \faketauhadvis backgrounds are estimated using (semi-)data-driven methods,
while minor ones are estimated using simulation. In the \hadhad channel, the
primary sources of \faketauhadvis are \ttbar and multi-jet production for which
separate estimation techniques are used. The \faketauhadvis background from
\ttbar (\ttbarFakes) is estimated using simulation after applying corrections of
\jettotauhadvis misidentification efficiencies measured in a CR. This method is
described in \Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ttbarfakes}. The multi-jet background is
estimated using a fully data-driven \emph{fake factor method} that is introduced
in \Cref{sec:bkg_hadhad_ff}. Both methods were developed as part of this thesis
and differ from the approach adopted in the previous publication in this
channel~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum}. Lastly, the estimation of the
\faketauhadvis backgrounds in the \lephad channels uses a \emph{combined fake
  factor method} that simultaneously estimates \faketauhadvis backgrounds from
multi-jet and \ttbar processes. This method is briefly summarised
in~\Cref{sec:bkg_lephad_combined_ff}.

Minor background contributions are estimated using simulation and are normalised
to the integrated luminosity of the \pp~collision dataset using the highest
order cross-section predictions available. These backgrounds are not discussed
in detail in this section, however, theoretical uncertainties on the modelling
of these processes using simulation are discussed in
\Cref{sec:modelling_uncertainties}.
