\label{sec:hadhad_multijet}

Multi-jet production is a source of background in the \hadhad signal
region where both \tauhadvis candidates originate from the
misidentification of quark- or gluon-initiated jets. It represents the
second largest background with \faketauhadvis in the \hadhad SR after
the dominant \ttbarFakes contribution.

\subsubsection{The fake factor method}

The multi-jet background is estimated using the fake factor method
which is a data-driven method for background estimation. It is
applicable in cases where two event observables exist that are
statistically independent for the background process to be estimated,
while also being strong discriminators between the background and
other processes (signal and non-multi-jet processes). Four disjoint
regions can be defined, three background-enriched control regions and
a signal-like region, by performing a binary categorisation of each
observable. The assumption of statistical independence allows to
relate the expected number of events for the background process
between the control regions and the signal-like region, thus yielding
a data-driven estimate of the expected background contribution in the
signal-like region.

In the \hadhad channel, two observables that allow to define control
regions enriched in multi-jet events are the \tauid requirements
fulfilled by the \tauhadvis candidates and the sign of the electric
charges of both candidates.

In the signal region, \tauhadvis candidates are required to pass the
loose \tauid working point. This requirement defines regions where
both \tauhadvis candidates pass identification which are herafter
referred to as ID regions. The selection is partially inverted to
obtain control regions enhanced in multi-jet events by requiring that
exactly one \tauhadvis candidate is failing the loose \tauid working
point, while still passing a working point corresponding to an
efficiency loss of \tauhad of about 1\,\% ($\text{RNN score} >
0.01$). The \tauhadvis candidates fulfilling this selection are
referred to as anti-\tauhadvis and the regions defined by the
inversion of the identification criterion as Anti-ID regions. The
identification criterion cannot be fully inverted due to
pre-selections\footnote{Datasets targeting $\PHiggs \to \hadhad$
  require events with at least one \tauhadvis passing the loose \tauid
  working point and one \tauhadvis with an RNN \tauid score exceeding
  0.01.} applied in the data reduction pipeline of the ATLAS
experiment. However, the fake factor method is still valid in the
presence of these constraints provided the underlying assumptions of
the method hold.

The electric charge of both \tauhadvis candidates produced from signal
processes and dominant sources of backgrounds with two \tauhadvis
orginating for hadronic $\tau$~decays ($\PZ \to \tautau$,
$\PHiggs \to \tautau$, \ttbar) are expected to be reconstructed with
opposite-sign (OS) electric charge. The OS requirement is inverted
yielding regions with \tauhadvis candidates of same-sign (SS) electric
charge, depleting the region of processes where both \tauhadvis
orginate from hadronic $\tau$ decays. In contrast, the multi-jet
background contributes similarly to the OS and SS regions since
\tauhadvis charge reconstruction has little sensitivity to the
relative sign of the electric charge between partons initiating jets
that are being misidentified as \tauhadvis.

With the previously defined control regions and assumption of
independence of both categorical observables, the expected multi-jet
contribution in regions with \tauhadvis passing loose identification
and with \tauhadvis pairs of opposite-sign electric charge can be
estimated using
\begin{align*}
  N_\text{multi-jet}^{\text{OS, ID}} =
  N_\text{multi-jet}^{\text{OS, Anti-ID}}
  \cdot
  \underbrace{\frac{N_\text{multi-jet}^{\text{SS, ID}}}
  {N_\text{multi-jet}^{\text{SS, Anti-ID}}}}
  _{= \text{FF}_\text{SS}} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
where $N_\text{multi-jet}$ is the number of multi-jet events in a
given region. The fake factor (FF) measures the ratio of multi-jet
events in the ID and Anti-ID region\footnote{The use of identification
  or isolation criteria to define the ratio is the main difference
  between the fake factor method and the more general ABCD method.}.

The probability of misidentifying a quark- or gluon-jet as a hadronic
$\tau$ decay depends on the properties of the reconstructed \tauhadvis
candidate. Particularly, the reconstructed decay mode and visible
transverse momentum affect the probability of a jet reconstructed as a
\tauhadvis to pass \tauid (cf.\ \Cref{sec:tauid}). To control for this
effect, fake factor measurements are frequently performed in bins of
observables related to properties of reconstructed
\tauhadvis.\todo{Does this fit here?}

The control regions defined by inverting the OS and ID requirements on
\tauhadvis do not provide pure samples of multi-jet events. Therefore,
number of multi-jet events is estimated according to
\begin{align*}
  N_\text{multi-jet} = N_\text{data} - N_\text{non-multi-jet} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
where $N_\text{data}$ is the observed number of events in the
multi-jet enriched region and $N_\text{non-multi-jet}$ the expected
contribution of non-multi-jet events estimated using simulation.

In~\Cref{tab:mjfakes_yields} the multi-jet and non-multi-jet yields in
the regions relevant for the \faketauhadvis estimation are
summarised. The 2 $b$-tag region, while most similar to the signal
region, is not well suited to estimate fake factors:
\begin{itemize}

\item The 2 $b$-tag regions used in the fake factor method have a
  large contamination from non-multi-jet backgrounds, primarily
  \ttbarFakes, that have to be subtracted. The large size of the
  subtraction leads to a degradation of the statistical precision of
  measured fake factors and inflates systematic uncertainties
  originating from the modelling of the subtracted components.

\item The \btag requirement suppresses the multi-jet contribution in
  the control regions preventing a differential measurement of fake
  factors in properties of the \tauhadvis.

\item The multi-jet estimate cannot be validated in the 2 $b$-tag
  region due to the absence of a region with high multi-jet purity
  that is similar to the signal region.

  % Resultingly, the statistical independence of the charge sign and ID
  % observables employed by the FF method cannot be verified.
\end{itemize}
These issues are addressed by performing the fake factor measurement
in the 1 $b$-tag region, which has a higher abundance and purity of
multi-jet events, and extrapolating the measurement into the 2 $b$-tag
region to obtain a multi-jet background estimate in the signal
region. Distributions of the \pT of the leading and sub-leading
\tauhadvis candidates in the regions relevant to the fake factor
measurement are shown in~\Cref{fig:mjfakes_1tag_ss_plots}.

\subsubsection{Measurement of fake factors}

% Binning in years / trigger
The fake factor measurement is performed separately for events
selected by single- and di-\tauhadvis triggers as well as the years of
data collection. During Run~2 of the LHC, different \tauhadvis trigger
chains were used by the ATLAS experiment to collect the data used in
this analysis. As a result, the topologies of the selected events and
the \tauid applied at the high-level trigger (HLT) changed as Run~2
progressed. To account for possible differences resulting from the
change in trigger-selection, the fake factor measurement is subdivided
into three major data collection periods: 2015-2016, 2017, and
2018. % The 1 $b$-tag SS regions relevant to the measurement of fake
% factors are shown in~\Cref{fig:mjfakes_1tag_ss_plots}.

% Reason for binning in
The categorisation of the fake factors by trigger that selected the
event is further motivated by the differences between single- and
di-\tauhadvis triggers. Single-\tauhadvis triggers require one
\tauhadvis candidate with high transverse momentum that is identified
at the HLT without any selections applied to the other candidate. In
contrast, di-\tauhadvis triggers require both \tauhadvis to be
identified at the HLT with similar transverse momentum thresholds
applied to both. This allows \tauhadvis candidates in in the
di-\tauhadvis trigger category to be treated equally once
\pT-threshold effects are accounted for. This is not the case in
events selected by single-\tauhadvis triggers.

Dependencies of the fake factors on reconstructed quantities of
\tauhadvis candidates are accounted for by further categorisation
based on the \tauhadvis that distinguishes the ID from the Anti-ID
regions. The fake factor measurement is performed separately for 1-
and 3-prong \tauhadvis candidates, independently of the trigger
category.

Fake factors for events selected by di-\tauhadvis triggers are
additionally measured in dependence of \tauhadvis \pT and separately
for \tauhadvis in the barrel and endcap regions of the ATLAS
detector. In contrast, few multi-jet events enter the
single-\tauhadvis trigger category due to stringent \pT requirements,
thus not allowing a large number of subdivisions for the
measurement. Therefore, the fake factors for singe-\tauhadvis trigger
events are measured separately for cases where the anti-\tauhadvis is
leading and the sub-leading in \pT, accounting for the differences in
HLT \tauid and (typically) large \tauhadvis \pT differences between
both candidates.


\subsubsection{Measurement of fake factors: di-\tauhadvis triggers}

{% Group for extra definitions

  \newcommand*{\NmjAntiID}[2]{\ensuremath{N_\text{multi-jet}^{\text{#1, anti-}\tau_{#2}}}\xspace}

  The Anti-ID region can be partitioned into two regions differing in
  whether the \tauhadvis candidate leading or sub-leading in \pT is
  reconstructed as the anti-\tauhadvis. Provided the conditions for
  the fake factor method are fulfilled, both regions can be used to
  obtain individual estimates of the multi-jet background in the OS ID
  region. The notation used to describe the fake factor measurement is
  introduced in the following:
  \begin{description}[style=standard]
  \item[$\tau_0$ ($\tau_1$)] The \tauhadvis candidate leading (sub-leading) in \pT.

  \item[$\myvec{x}_\tau$] Categorical observables of a \tauhadvis
    candidate that define the bin of the fake factor measurement. The
    observables used for the di-\tauhadvis trigger fake factors are
    the reconstructed decay mode ($N_\text{tracks}$), the bin of
    \tauhadvis \pT, and the bin of \tauhadvis $\eta$.

  \item[$\NmjID{SS(OS)}{i}\ffargs$] Number of multi-jet events in the
    SS (OS) ID region where~$\tau_i$ has
    observables~$\myvec{x}_\tau$. \todo{Maybe distinguish better from
      the FF estimate?}

  \item[$\NmjAntiID{SS(OS)}{i}\ffargs$] Number of multi-jet events in
    the SS (OS) Anti-ID region where $\tau_i$ is the anti-\tauhadvis
    with observables~$\myvec{x}_\tau$.
  \end{description}
  With these definitions, two sets of fake factors can be defined as
  \begin{align*}
    \FF_{i}\ffargs &= \frac{\NmjID{SS}{i} \ffargs}{\NmjAntiID{SS}{i}\ffargs}
                     \quad \text{for} \quad i = 0, 1 \,\text{,}
  \end{align*}
  where $\FF_{i}$ is the fake factor relating the ID region with the
  partition of the Anti-ID region where $\tau_i$ is the
  anti-\tauhadvis. These can be used to obtain two multi-jet estimates
  in the OS region given by
  \begin{align*}
    \NmjID{OS}{i}\ffargs = \FF_{i}\ffargs \cdot \NmjAntiID{OS}{i}\ffargs
    \quad \text{for} \quad i = 0, 1 \,\text{.}
  \end{align*}
  An average of both estimates can be calculated, yielding fake
  factors that are inclusive in whether the anti-\tauhadvis is the
  leading or sub-leading \tauhadvis candidate. The inclusive fake
  factors can be expressed as
  \begin{align*}
    \FF_\text{incl.}\ffargs = \frac{1}{2} \left[ f_0\ffargs \cdot \FF_0\ffargs
    + f_1\ffargs \cdot \FF_1\ffargs \right] \,\text{,}
  \end{align*}
  with $f_i\ffargs$ being the fraction of Anti-ID events where
  $\tau_i$ is the anti-\tauhadvis and has
  observables~$\myvec{x}_\tau$. The inclusive fake factor can be
  measured directly according to
  \begin{align}
    \FF_\text{incl.}\ffargs
    = \frac{1}{2} \frac{ \NmjID{SS}{0}\ffargs + \NmjID{SS}{1}\ffargs }
                       { \NmjAntiID{SS}{0}\ffargs + \NmjAntiID{SS}{1}\ffargs }
    \label{eq:inclusive_fake_factor}
  \end{align}
  and the multi-jet estimate in the OS region obtained by
  \begin{align*}
    \NmjIDIncl{OS}\ffargs = \FF_\text{incl.}\ffargs \cdot \NmjAntiIDIncl{OS}\ffargs \,\text{,}
  \end{align*}
  where $\NmjAntiIDIncl{OS}\ffargs$ is the number of multi-jet events
  in the OS Anti-ID region\todo{Emphasise that this is now the
    inclusive region?} with anti-\tauhadvis $\myvec{x}_\tau$.

  % Prior the agreement of the background estimates obtained with FF0
  % and FF1 were confirmed.

  The motivation of using inclusive fake factors is two-fold. First,
  it allows to use all events entering the Anti-ID region, independent
  of whether the anti-\tauhadvis is leading or sub-leading in \pT,
  thus improving the statistical precision of the background
  estimate. Second, the fake factors can be parametrised in the
  properties of the anti-\tauhadvis directly, allowing to target the
  key differences between the ID and Anti-ID regions. This represents
  a change with respect to the previous
  publication~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum} where fake factors were
  parametrised jointly in the properties of both \tauhadvis
  candidates, thus limiting the statistical precision of the fake
  factor measurement due to high dimensionality\todo{Note that
    previously AA events were considered?}.

}

The inclusive fake factors for events selected by di-\tauhadvis
triggers are measured according to~\Cref{eq:inclusive_fake_factor} and
parametrised in \tauhadvis decay mode, transverse momentum,
pseudorapidity, and the period of data collection. The number of
multi-jet events is obtained by subtracting the expected number of
non-multi-jet events estimated using simulation from the number of
observed events in data. The measured fake factors are summarised
in~\Cref{fig:mjfakes_fake_factors}.

  \label{fig:mjfakes_fake_factors}
\end{figure}

Qualitatively, the behaviour of the fake factors with respect to the
\tauhadvis properties is the same between all data collection
periods. Minor differences exist when comparing different periods. No
attempt was made to combine the measurements of certain periods as the
statistical precision of the fake factor measurement is not a limiting
factor in the analysis.


\subsubsection{Measurement of fake factors: single-\tauhadvis triggers}

The measurement of fake factors for events selected by
single-\tauhadvis triggers has to proceed differenty from the
di-\tauhadvis trigger case. First, at the HLT \tauhadvis
identification is only applied to one of the \tauhadvis candidates,
preventing an inclusive treatment of both \tauhadvis
candidates. Second, the high \pT thresholds on \tauhadvis at
trigger-level has high rejection of most SM processes, limiting the
number of events entering the control regions for the fake factor
measurement. As a result, the fake factors for singe-\tauhadvis
triggers cannot be measured differentially in \tauhadvis \pT and
$\eta$.

The STT fake factors are measured in four categories for every major
period of data collection: 1- and 3-prong \tauhadvis and whether the
\tauhadvis is leading or sub-leading in \pT. The resulting fake
factors are summarised in~\Cref{fig:mjfakes_stt_ffs}.

\todo[inline]{Old stuff below:}

The fake factor (FF) measures the ratio of events with fake \tauhadvis in ID and
Anti-ID region:
\begin{align*}
  \FF = \frac{N\left( \text{fake} \, \tauhadvis, \text{ID} \right)}{N\left( \text{fake} \, \tauhadvis, \text{Anti-ID} \right)}
\end{align*}
The probability of a jet faking a \tauhadvis depends strongly on \tauhadvis \pT
and decay mode. Therefore, the fake factor is frequently parametrised in these
quantities. It is also affected by the \tauhadvis identification already applied
in the high-level \tauhadvis-triggers which also needs to be taken into account.

The fake factors are measured in the fake enriched SS-region by subtracting
non-fake-\tauhadvis background using their estimates from simulation:
\begin{align*}
  \FF_\text{SS} = \frac{N(\text{SS}, \text{ID}) - N_\text{non-fake}(\text{SS}, \text{ID})}{N(\text{SS}, \text{Anti-ID}) - N_\text{non-fake}(\text{SS}, \text{Anti-ID})}
\end{align*}
where $N$ is the total yield and $N_\text{non-fake}$ the yield of
non-fake-\tauhadvis backgrounds in the corresponding region.

To obtain the fake \tauhadvis estimate in the OS ID-region, the assumption is
made that the fake factors are independent of the reconstructed charge of the
fake \tauhadvis candidates. Therefore, the SS fake factors $\FF_\text{SS}$ are
applied to events in the OS Anti-ID region after subtracting any
non-fake-\tauhadvis contributions.
\begin{align*}
  N(\text{fake}, \text{OS ID}) = \FF_\text{SS} \times \left[ N(\text{OS}, \text{Anti-ID}) - N_\text{non-fake}(\text{OS}, \text{Anti-ID}) \right]
\end{align*}
Systematic uncertainties are assigned to
cover possible difference betwen OS and SS fake factors, varying the
subtraction in the OS Anti-ID region. Moreover, the fake factors are
independently varied by their statistical uncertainty.

Due to the limited acceptance of fake \tauhadvis in the 2 \btag region, the 1
\btag region is used to calculate the fake factors instead. The 1 \btag fake
factors are applied to the 2 \btag OS Anti-ID region and an additional 1 to 2
\btag transfer factor is applied.

The binning of the fake factors is dependent on the trigger that selected the
event. For STT events the fake factor is binned in whether the anti-\tauhadvis
is leading or subleading in \pT, and the decay mode of the \tauhadvis
($N_\text{track}$). Due to low statistics in the STT category the fake factors
are inclusive in \tauhadvis \pT. The \tauhadvis identification at the HLT is
only applied to one of the two \tauhadvis candidates affecting the probability
of jets faking \tauhadvis, motivating the binning in whether the leading /
subleading \tauhadvis fails the identification.

For DTT events, HLT \tauhadvis identification is applied to both \tauhadvis
candidates. Therefore, the fake factors do not need to distinguish between cases
where the leading and subleading \tauhadvis fails the loose identification. The
fake factors for DTT events are parametrised in the \pT and decay mode of the
the \tauhadvis candidate failing the identification requirement.

Moreover, all fake factors are binned by data-taking period (${\text{2015-2016},
  \text{2017}, \text{2018}}$) which takes into account the different triggers
being used to select events used for the analysis.
