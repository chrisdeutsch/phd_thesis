\section{Statistical analysis}
\label{sec:statistical_analysis}

The statistical analysis of the results proceeds using the frequentist
framework presented in~\Cref{sec:statistical_methods} to search for
non-resonant production of SM \HH and production via scalar resonances
with masses ranging from \SIrange{251}{1600}{\GeV}.

A probabilistic model is constructed, for the given signal hypothesis
to be probed, that simultaneously describes the observables in bins of
the MVA descriminants in the signal regions and \mll in the \ZHF
control region using the signal and background estimates and their
uncertainties described in earlier sections. The discriminants are
summarised in~\Cref{tab:fitted_variable} for all regions entering the
models for the SM and BSM search.

The parameters of interest (POI) for the search for non-resonant SM
\HH production are the cross section of the combination of the ggF and
VBF production modes, \xsecggfvbf, and the signal strength
\begin{align*}
  \mu = \frac{\xsecggfvbf}{\xsecggfvbf^{\text{SM}}} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
which measures the cross section relative to the Standard Model
prediction
of~$\xsecggfvbf^{\text{SM}} = \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \text{ (ggF)} +
\SI{1.726}{\femto\barn} \text{
  (VBF)}$~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd,Dreyer:2018qbw}. In the BSM scenario
of resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via scalar resonances,
only the total cross section of $\sigma(pp \to X \to HH)$ is
considered as the POI. Moreover, the non-resonant production of SM \HH
is not considered as a background in the search for scalar resonances
as there is no experimental evidence for its existence yet.

In the following, the details of the signal and background model are
described in~\Cref{sec:sig_bkg_model}. In~\Cref{sec:results_nonres}
and~\Cref{sec:results_res} the results are presented.

\subsection{The signal and background model}%
\label{sec:sig_bkg_model}

The signal and background model describes the expected number of
events in bins .

The sensitivity to a given signal depends due to the use of MVA
discriminants (cf.\ \Cref{tab:fitted_variable})

The use of MVA discriminants in the statistical analysis .

The binning of data in the \ZHF control region is the same in all
cases (cf.\ REFERENCE).


The model described in the following is to be used in a simultaneous
maximum likelihood fit of binned MVA discriminants.

For every signal hypothesis dedicated models are constructed.

The signal considered for non-resonant SM \HH search are ggF+VBF.

\todo[inline]{Simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of binned MVA
  discriminants and control regions to estimate the model parameters.}

The statistical uncertainties on the background prediction using
simulation and control region data are implemented in the likelihood
model according to the simplified Barlow-Beeston method introduced
in~\Cref{sec:barlow_beeston}.

\subsubsection{Re-binning algorithm}%
\label{sec:binning_alg}

The signal sensitivity of a binned maximum likelihood fit of
MVA scores depends strongly on the choice of binning used for the
discriminant. The purity of signal increases with increasing MVA
score, with most signal (background) being concentrated at the highest
(lowest) MVA scores. For optimal expected signal sensitivity, the
binning has to be chosen such that regions in MVA score with low
signal-to-background ratio are separated from regions with high
signal-to-background ratio.

In this analysis an iterative re-binning algorithm is used to provide
the binning of the discriminants for the likelihood fits. The aim of
the algorithm is to provide good expected signal sensitivity while
ensuring that the background model obeys predefined constraints on the
statistical uncertainty and expected number of events in each bin. The
constraints are intended to stabilise the likelihood fits and ensure
reasonable validity of the asymptotic approximations used for the
sampling distributions of test statistics used in the statistical
analysis. The algorithm was previously used
in~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum} and is continued to be used in the
\hadhad channel of this search. A different algorithm, while
conceptually similar, is used in the \lephad channel and is
detailed~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-030}.

The re-binning algorithm is provided with MVA score histograms with
fine, equidistant binning ($N_\text{bins} = 1000$) for the signal and
total background expectation. It proceeds by iteratively merging bins,
starting from the most-signal like MVA score bins, until the bin
fulfills a set of requirements:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The relative statistical uncertainty of the background in the
  bin must be smaller
  than~\mbox{$\SI{50}{\percent} \cdot f_\text{s} + \SI{1}{\percent}$},
  where $f_\text{s}$ is the fraction of signal events entering the bin
  relative to the expected number of signal events in the signal
  region. This requirement limits the statistical uncertainty on the
  background in the most signal-like bins after re-binning to be in
  the range of \SIrange{10}{20}{\percent}.

\item The expected number of background events in the bin must be
  larger than 5.

\end{enumerate}
When a bin fulfilling all requirements is found, the process is
repeated starting from the next un-merged bin. The algorithm
terminates with a final bin at low MVA score. If the final bin does
not fulfil the criteria, it is merged with the preceeding (already
merged) bin.

% The algorithm provides a binning that improves the analysis
% sensitivity while fulfilling criteria on the background model:
% I.e. that it has reasonable statistical precision, and that one
% expects at least 5 events so that asymptotic approximations of the
% test statistics can be used.

% Motivation of terms:
% 1\% have some bins in background dominated region
% signal fraction weighted 50\% to have relatively fine bins in the most signal-like regions

The size of bins resulting from the re-binning procedure can vary by
multiple orders of magnitude. For better visualisation of the bin
contents, the MVA scores are displayed as equidistant bins.

The background-only hypothesis is compared to the alternative of the
background in addition to a positive SM \HH signal with
strength~$\mu$. The likelihood ratio test comparing both hypotheses
yields an observed $p$-value of \SI{27.5}{\percent} (expected
$p$-value of \SI{25.2}{\percent} from the $\mu = 1$ Asimov
dataset). Therefore, the background-only hypothesis cannot be rejected
and thus upper limits on the SM \HH signal strength and cross sections
are placed using the \CLs method.
