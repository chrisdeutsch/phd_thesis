\section{Statistical interpretation}
\label{sec:statistical_analysis}

The statistical interpretation of the results proceeds using the frequentist
framework presented in~\Cref{sec:statistical_methods} to search for
non-resonant production of SM \HH and production via scalar resonances
with masses ranging from \SIrange{251}{1600}{\GeV}.

A probabilistic model is constructed targeting the signal hypothesis
to be probed that simultaneously describes the data in bins of the MVA
descriminants in the signal regions and \mll in the \ZHF control
region using the signal and background estimates and their
uncertainties described in earlier sections. The discriminants are
summarised in~\Cref{tab:fitted_variable} for all regions entering the
models for the SM and BSM search.

The parameters of interest (POI) for the search for non-resonant SM
\HH production are the cross section of the combination of the \ggF and
VBF production modes, \xsecggfvbf, and the signal strength
\begin{align*}
  \mu = \frac{\xsecggfvbf}{\xsecggfvbf^{\text{SM}}} \,\text{,}
\end{align*}
which measures the cross section relative to the Standard Model
prediction
of~$\xsecggfvbf^{\text{SM}} = \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \text{ (\ggF)} +
\SI{1.726}{\femto\barn} \text{
  (VBF)}$~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd,Dreyer:2018qbw}. In the BSM scenario
of resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via scalar resonances,
only the total cross section of $\sigma(pp \to X \to HH)$ is
considered as the POI. Moreover, the non-resonant production of SM \HH
is not considered as a background in the search for scalar resonances
as there is no experimental evidence for its existence yet.

In the following, the details of the signal and background model are
described in~\Cref{sec:sig_bkg_model}. In~\Cref{sec:results_nonres}
and~\Cref{sec:results_res} the results are presented.

\subsection{The signal and background model}%
\label{sec:sig_bkg_model}

The signal and background model describes the expected number of
events in bins .

The sensitivity to a given signal depends due to the use of MVA
discriminants (cf.\ \Cref{tab:fitted_variable})

The use of MVA discriminants in the statistical analysis .

The binning of data in the \ZHF control region is the same in all
cases (cf.\ REFERENCE).


The model described in the following is to be used in a simultaneous
maximum likelihood fit of binned MVA discriminants.

For every signal hypothesis dedicated models are constructed.

The signal considered for non-resonant SM \HH search are \ggF+VBF.

\todo[inline]{Simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of binned MVA
  discriminants and control regions to estimate the model parameters.}

The statistical uncertainties on the background prediction using
simulation and control region data are implemented in the likelihood
model according to the simplified Barlow-Beeston method introduced
in~\Cref{sec:barlow_beeston}.

\subsubsection{Re-binning algorithm}%
\label{sec:binning_alg}

The signal sensitivity of likelihood-ratio tests using binned MVA
score distributions depends on the choice of binning used for the
discriminant. The purity of signal increases with increasing MVA
score, with most signal (background) being concentrated at the highest
(lowest) scores. For good expected signal sensitivity, the binning has
to be chosen such that regions in MVA score with low
signal-to-background ratio are separated from regions with high
signal-to-background ratio.

In this analysis an iterative re-binning algorithm is used to
determine the binning of MVA discriminants used to construct the
likelihood functions. The aim of the algorithm is to provide large
expected signal sensitivity while ensuring that the background
prediction obeys predefined constraints on the statistical uncertainty
and expected number of events in each bin. The constraints are
intended to stabilise the fits and ensure validity of asymptotic
approximations of the sampling distributions of the test statistics
used in the analysis. The algorithm described in the
following was previously used in Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum}
and is continued to be used in the \hadhad channel of this search. A
different algorithm, while conceptually similar, is used in the
\lephad channels and is described in Ref.~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-030}.

The re-binning algorithm is provided with MVA score histograms with
fine, equidistant binning ($N_\text{bins} = 1000$) of the signal and
total background expectation at the nominal values of all nuisance
parameters. It proceeds by iteratively merging bins, starting from the
most-signal like MVA score bins, until the bin fulfills a set of
requirements:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The relative statistical uncertainty of the background
  prediction in the bin must be smaller
  than~\mbox{$\SI{50}{\percent} \times f_\text{s} +
    \SI{1}{\percent}$}, where $f_\text{s}$ is the fraction of signal
  events in the bin relative to the total number of signal events in
  the considered region.  This requirement limits the statistical
  uncertainty of the background estimate in the most signal-like bins
  after re-binning to be in the range of \SIrange{10}{20}{\percent}.

\item The expected number of background events in the bin must be
  larger than 5.

\end{enumerate}
When a bin fulfilling all requirements is found, the process is
repeated starting from the next bin that is not yet merged. The
algorithm terminates with a final bin at low MVA score. If the final
bin does not fulfil the criteria, it is merged with the preceeding
bin.

The size of bins resulting from the re-binning procedure can vary by
multiple orders of magnitude. For better visualisation of the bin
contents, the MVA scores are displayed as equidistant bins.

% The algorithm provides a binning that improves the analysis
% sensitivity while fulfilling criteria on the background model:
% I.e. that it has reasonable statistical precision, and that one
% expects at least 5 events so that asymptotic approximations of the
% test statistics can be used.

% Motivation of terms: 1\% have some bins in background dominated
% region signal fraction weighted 50\% to have relatively fine bins in
% the most signal-like regions


\subsubsection{Merging of physics processes}

The signal and background models are simplified by merging samples
originating from similar underlying physics processes which are
subject to equal treatment in the fit model. In the SM \HH search, the
\ggF and VBF samples are merged, defining the total signal contribution
from both production modes. The \Zjets samples are combined into
$Z + (bb,bc,cc)$ and $Z + (bl,cl,ll)$ samples, separately for
$Z \to \tau\tau$ and $Z \to \ell^+\ell^-$, where $\ell = e,
\mu$. Further, contributions from diboson and single top production
(including $tW$) are merged into two separate samples.

The treatment merging for \faketauhadvis backgrounds differs between
the \hadhad and \lephad channels. In the \hadhad channel two separate
samples are used for \tauhadvis background from multi-jet and \ttbar
production. In \lephad channels, all \faketauhadvis contributions are
merged since the estimation method does not distinguish between the
\faketauhadvis source.

The merging of samples should not have a large effect on the
statistical analysis. The only differences arise from symmetrisation,
smoothing, and pruning algorithms (discussed in the following) acting
on merged samples instead of the initial components.


\subsubsection{Symmetrisation of systematic uncertainties}

Uncertainties arising from MC-to-MC comparisons, for example for
alternative generator configurations (e.g.\ variations of the ME or PS
generation), provide only a single systematic variation and thus
cannot be readily incorporated into the likelihood function using a
Gaussian constraint term for the associated uncertainty. These
\emph{one-sided uncertainties} are therefore symmetrised by mirroring
their effect with respect to the nominal prediction. This procedure is
used for all uncertainties resulting from a comparison with a single
alternative prediction.

For some uncertainties the $+1\sigma$ and the $-1\sigma$ variation
changes the prediction in one or multiple bins in the same direction
with respect to the nominal prediction. For such cases, examples being
jet-related uncertainties affecting the four-momenta of reconstructed
jets, the uncertainties are symmetrised by assigning half of the
difference between the up and down variations as a symmetric
uncertainty on the nominal prediction.


\subsubsection{Inter- and extrapolation of systematic uncertainties}

To define a (continuous) likelihood function, the signal and
background predictions have to be parametrised as continuous functions
of the nuisance parameters. Conventionally, uncertainties on the
normalisation or the normalisation and shape of a prediction in a
given analysis region are determined only for two values of the
nuisance parameters correponding to $\pm 1\sigma$ ($\alpha = \pm 1$)
variations in addition to the nominal prediction. The parametrised
predictions needed for the definition of the likelihood function are
obtained using interpolation ($\vert \alpha \vert \leq 1$) and
extrapolation methods ($\vert \alpha \vert > 1$) provided by
\textsc{HistFactory}~\cite{cranmer2012}.

All uncertainties are decomposed into two correlated components
employing different inter- and extrapolation methods. The first
component are uncertainties on the sample normalisations in a given
region which are parametrised using multiplicative normalisation
factors determined from 6th order polynomial interpolation and
exponential extrapolation in $\alpha$. Exponential extrapolation is
used to prevent the normalisation factors from becoming negative. The
second component are shape variations of the discriminant in a given
region that leave the normalisation invariant. The parametrised shape
variations are obtained using 6th order polynomial interpolation and
linear extrapolation. In both cases the resulting functions are
required to be continuous and have continuous first and second
derivatives at the boundaries.


\subsubsection{Smoothing and pruning of systematic uncertainties}

% https://indico.cern.ch/event/736395/contributions/3040869/attachments/1671620/2684026/SmoothingPruning.pdf
% https://cds.cern.ch/record/2692202/files/CERN-THESIS-2018-447.pdf
The derivation of shape uncertainties are susceptible to statistical
fluctuations\footnote{This is can also be the case for normalisation
  uncertainties which are not the subject of the smoothing
  algorithm. In this case the user is responsible to ensure that
  normalisation uncertainties are determined with sufficient
  precision.} which can introduce spurious pulls and constraints on
nuisance parameters when performing maximum likelihood fits of the
model. Frequently this is the case when shape uncertainties are
derived from MC-to-MC comparisons or from variations that change the
four-momentum of final state particles. In these cases a smoothing
procedure is applied to the templates describing the uncertainties on
the shape of the discriminant. Shape uncertainties that are based on
the reweighting of the nominal prediction are less sensitive to
statistical fluctuations, unless the weight distribution has high
variance, and thus no smoothing is applied by default. Exceptions are
made in some cases for example for the weight-based FSR uncertainties
for the production of top quarks for which smoothing is applied due to
the large variance of the associated weight distribution.

The smoothing procedure, adopted from Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2013-23}, uses
iterative rebinning of the histogram-based templates describing the
shape uncertainties, merging bins starting with bins that are most
compatible until the statistical uncertainty in all bins is below
\SI{5}{\percent} and the shape template has a monotonic
dependency\todo{Why?} on the (MVA) discriminant. This procedure is
applied, when configured for a given uncertainty, separately for all
analysis regions and samples after merging.

The signal and background model is further simplified by removing
small systematic variations. This pruning procedure is applied
separately for all samples and analysis regions after merging,
symmetrisation, and smoothing. Additionally, uncertainties on the
normalisation and shape are pruned separately. The normalisation
component of an uncertainty for a given sample and analysis category
is removed if both the $+1\sigma$ and $-1\sigma$ variations are within
\SI{0.5}{\percent} with respect to the nominal prediction. The shape
component of an uncertainty is removed if both the $+1\sigma$ and
$-1\sigma$ variations results in changes within \SI{0.5}{\percent} of
the nominal prediction in all bins in the analysis region.


\subsubsection{Nuisance parameter correlation scheme}

- All norm factors ( affecting signal, Z+(bb,bc,cc),
ttbar/ttbarFakes(in hadhad) ) are fully correlated between all
channels. Uncertainties on the relative acceptance are correlated when
they are from the same source with the exception of the.

- All event and object reconstruction (and lumi) related uncertainties
are fully correlated between all channels.

- Theoretical uncertainties on cross sections and acceptances are
correlated between all channels (if they are from the same source).

- Nuisance parameters on the data-driven background estimation are
separate since different methods are used.

- Decorrelate parton shower systematics for ttbar between lephad and
hadhad


\subsubsection{Model validation}

The model is developed and validated by performing:

1. Fits of Asimov datasets

2. Fits of data in control regions

3. Fits of data in control regions and MVA discriminants with only
\hadhad / \lephad signal regions.

4. Fits of data control regions and MVA discriminants blinding the
high MVA score regions.

Based on these studies decisions where made on decorrelation of
uncertainties (PS) and symmetrisation / smoothing applied to
uncertainties.


\subsection{Results of the search for non-resonant production of SM $HH$}
\label{sec:results_nonres}

The results of the search for non-resonant production of SM \HH are
presented in the following for the combination of all
channels. Results are also presented prior to the combination of the
\hadhad and \lephad channels to illustrate the signal sensitivity of
individual channels and differences in the impact of systematic
uncertainties.

All results are obtained from the model using the SM \HH signal
strength as the POI unless otherwise noted. Further merging of physics
processes is performed for illustration only. The contributions from
top quark pair and single top production are combined into the ``top
quark'' background. Contributions from minor backgrounds are combined
into the ``other'' background category which includes the processes
$Z \to \tautau + (bl,cl,ll)$, $Z \to e^{+}e^{-}$ and
$Z \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ inclusive in the flavour label of the $b$-jet
candidates, \Wjets, diboson, and $\ttbar V$.

The normalisation factors of \ttbar and \ZHF estimated using a

In~\Cref{fig:mvascores_postfit} the MVA score distributions predicted
by the background-only model are compared to data in the \hadhad,
\lephad SLT, and \lephad LTT channels after the maximum likelihood fit
combining all signal and control regions. After performing the fit,
the background model provides a good description of the data observed
in the signal regions. Additionally, the expected event yields per
process in these regions after the fit are summarised
in~\Cref{tab:postfit_yields_smhh}.

The choice of analysis strategy of using multivariate discriminants to
extract the signal of interest from loosely preselected events limits
the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the background processes
that are relevant to the signal extraction process. Therefore,
\Cref{tab:postfit_yields_smhh_signallike} lists the expected event
yields for the two most signal-like bins of the MVA discriminants,
illustrating the background composition in a phase space comparable to
the one occupied by the signal process.

% Top quark: 3(ttbar):1(stop)
The dominant background in the two most signal-like bins of the SM \HH
BDT in the \hadhad channel is the production of \ZHF with an
expectation of about 8 events. The contribution of top quark, single
Higgs boson, and \faketauhadvis backgrounds is similar with an
expectation of about 4 events for each process. The signal efficiency
of selecting the two most signal-like bins is close to
\SI{50}{\percent} with respect to the signal yield after
pre-selection, yielding the largest signal-to-background ratio of any
individual channel in this search.

% Top quark (SLT): 1(ttbar):1(stop)
% Top quark (LTT): 5(ttbar):1(stop)
In the \lephad channels the dominant backgrounds in the signal-like
bins are originating from the production of top quarks and
\ZHF. Compared to the \hadhad channel, top quark backgrounds are more
abundant\footnote{The targeted $\ell + \tauhad$ final state does not
  distinguish between prompt production of electrons / muons and
  non-prompt production via leptonic \taulepton decays, thus both
  $W \to \taulep \nu_{\tau}$ and $W \to \ell \nu_{\ell}$ ($\ell = e$
  or $\mu$) are considered as \taulepvis candidates. Backgrounds from
  \ttbar or $tW$ production would be about seven times more abundant
  in the \lephad channel compared to the \hadhad channel based on $W$
  boson and \taulepton branching ratios (taken from
  Ref.~\cite{pdg2020}) prior to the event reconstruction, and
  disregarding \faketauhadvis contributions.}  with a large
contribution of about \SI{50}{\percent} from single top production in
the SLT channel (ca.\ \SI{15}{\percent} in LTT). The selection of the
two most signal-like bins yields smaller signal efficiencies while
having background rates that are comparable between the three
channels. This is due to the abundance of top quark backgrounds and
the larger difficulty of reconstructing the $H \to \tautau$ candidate
in \lephad decay modes, degrading the resolution of the $\tautau$ and
\HH mass reconstruction.

The modelling of MVA input variables in the \hadhad channel can be
inspected in~\Cref{fig:postfit_mva_inputs}, which shows the variables
after the background-only fit of the MVA discriminants to observed
data, combining all channels of the analysis. The post-fit background
model describes the observed data well with minor discrepancies in the
angular observables. For example at low values of \dRtautau the
background model tends to overestimate the observed data by about
\SI{10}{\percent} which is not fully covered by uncertainties.

A post hoc analysis of the mismodelling observed at low \dRtautau is
performed by examining the dependency of the measured \ZHF
normalisation factor as a function of the transverse momentum of the
$Z$ boson by performing a simplified normalisation measurement in the
control region in bins of~$\pT(Z)$ reconstructed from the lepton
transverse momenta. This cross-check shows a trend of decreasing \ZHF
normalisation factors with increasing $\pT(Z)$ which can lead to
differences of about \SIrange{5}{10}{\percent} at typical values of
$\pT(Z)$ after the \hadhad pre-selection (approx.\
$\SI{100}{\GeV} < \pT(Z) < \SI{200}{\GeV}$) when comparing to the
$\pT(Z)$-inclusive normalisation factor. Due to the anticorrelation
between $\pT(Z)$ and \dRtautau, this effect can be further enhanced in
regions of low \dRtautau. The acceptance uncertainties on the \ZHF
background, which are derived purely based on simulation, might not
fully account for the effect as it is observed in control region
data. In future analyses it could be beneficial to control for such
differential effects when performing auxiliary measurements of the
\ZHF background.\todo{Put a plot in appendix?}

After visually inspecting the goodness of fit between the
background-only model and the observed data, a formal comparison of
the competing hypotheses is performed. The background-only hypothesis
is tested against the alternative that includes a SM \HH signal with
non-negative signal strength using a likelihood ratio test. The test
yields an observed $p_0$-value of \SI{27}{\percent} and thus the
background-only hypothesis cannot be rejected.

The signal strength obtained from the unconditional fit is
$\hat{\mu} = 0.9\,\numpmerr{+1.8}{-1.5}$ for the combination of all
channels\footnote{The best-fit signal strength of the fit combining
  \hadhad channel and CR is $\hat{\mu} = 0.7\,\numpmerr{+1.9}{-1.6}$
  and for \lephad channels and CR,
  $\hat{\mu} = 1.9\,\numpmerr{+3.7}{-3.2}$.}, which is compatible with
the signal strength in the SM but also with the absence of Higgs boson
pair production.

The dominant uncertainties affecting the measurement of the SM \HH
signal strength are summarised in~\Cref{tab:breakdown_nonres} for the
combination of all channels. The measurement is mainly limited by the
statistical uncertainty originating from the small number of events
observed at high values of the MVA discriminants, explaining about
$\frac{2}{3}$ of the variance on \muhat. Systematic uncertainties play
a sub-leading role explaining the remaining third of the total
variance on \muhat. The largest sources of systematic uncertainty are
originating from the modelling of the SM backgrounds and the
statistical precision of the background estimate.

The effect of uncertainties on \muhat is examined on the level of
individual nuisance parameters in~\Cref{fig:nonres_np_rankings}
separately for the combination of all channels and for fits of the
\hadhad and \lephad channels individually. A ranking of the 15
nuisance parameters with the largest impact on the signal strength
estimation is shown, including the MLE of the nuisance parameters and
their \SI{68}{\percent} confidence intervals from the unconditional
fit to observed data.

The 15 highest ranked nuisance parameters show good compatibility with
their values prior to the fit. For few nuisance parameters the fit
provides more stringent constraints than suggested by their prior
measurement, which is consistent with the results obtained from fits
to Asimov datasets.

The largest NP constraint observed in the \hadhad channel fit is from
the \ZHF acceptance uncertainty determined from MC-to-MC comparison of
\SHERPA and \MGNLOPY. The uncertainty associated with this NP is
expected to be conservative, since it arises from a comparison of the
nominal event generation at NLO with a prediction lower order of the
pertubative expansion (LO).

In the \lephad channel, large constraints are observed on the nuisance
parameter associated to the uncertainty on $r_{\text{QCD}}$ and the
\ttbar acceptance uncertainty from the comparison of parton shower
programs. The uncertainty on $r_{\text{QCD}}$ is derived to be
conservative, varying the assumed fraction of \faketauhadvis
originating from multi-jet processes in the anti-\tauhadvis control
region between 0 and \SI{100}{\percent}, explaining the large
constraints on this parameter. The constraints on the \ttbar
acceptance uncertainty based on the parton shower comparison stems
from the \lephad SLT channel which has high purity of top quark
backgrounds. Since the constraint is large, this uncertainty source is
de-correlated between channels to avoid underestimating the acceptance
uncertainty in other channels based on the measurement in the \lephad
SLT channel\todo{Should mention this earlier?}.

A few features of the ranking of nuisance parameters / nuisance
parameter categories, as previously presented in
\Cref{tab:breakdown_nonres} and \Cref{fig:nonres_np_rankings}, are
highlighted in the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical uncertainties on the background prediction have a
  large impact when comparing to other systematic uncertainties. These
  uncertainties arise from the finite number of simulated events used
  for the background predictions and the number of control region
  events used to perform the data-driven \faketauhadvis background
  estimates.

  The distinct features of Higgs boson pair production in the SM allow
  to separate the targeted signal well from most background processes
  when employing multivariate techniques. Therefore, simulation-based
  background predictions, while generally produced with integrated
  luminosities exceeding that of the collected data\footnote{The data
    statistical uncertainties, not the statistical precision of the
    background prediction, are the primary limitation for the signal
    extraction as can be seen in~\Cref{tab:breakdown_nonres}.}, do not
  populate the region of high MVA scores densely, leading to
  non-negligible statistical uncertainties on the background
  predictions in the most signal-like bins.

  Additionally, the data-driven estimate of the multi-jet background
  in the \hadhad channel includes large subtractions of non-multi-jet
  events in the control region, further degrading the statistical
  precision of the background estimate. As a result, in the
  \hadhad-only fit the associated nuisance parameter has the largest
  impact of any single NP on the extracted signal strength (cf.\
  $\gamma$ NP for SMBDT bin 13
  in~\Cref{fig:nonres_np_ranking_hadhad}).

\item The $tW$ acceptance uncertainty derived from comparing simulated
  events with different treatment of the $tW$ and \ttbar interference
  is the NP with the largest impact on \muhat for both the combined
  and the \lephad-only fit. It primarily originates from the \lephad
  SLT channel where the uncertainty on $tW$ can reach up to
  \SI{80}{\percent} at high NN score. Moreover, single top production
  constitutes about \SI{50}{\percent} of the top background at high NN
  score in the \lephad SLT channel, resulting in a large impact of
  this NP on the signal extraction. This uncertainty has less impact
  in the \hadhad and \lephad LTT channel due to the $tW$ fraction and
  the uncertainty itself being smaller\todo{Technically the LTT
    uncertainty is about the same}.

\item The uncertainty on the acceptance of $gg \to H \to \tautau$
  production in association with quarks of heavy flavour has a large
  impact on \muhat. The most signal-like bins of the BDT discriminant
  used in the \hadhad channel select a considerable number of single
  Higgs boson events of which ca.\ X are from \ggF leading to large
  uncertainties (since 100\% is assigned).
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{Discussion: Impact of data statistical uncertainties is
  about the same -> Speaks for improvements in CP and the
  analysis. Instrumental decreased in full Run~2. Huge improvements in
  calibration measurements.} The effect of uncertainties is similar
to the previous Run~2 analysis~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum} using a
partial dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$ with
\SI{36.1}{\per\femto\barn} integrated luminosity.

In the absence of statistical evidence for SM \HH production, upper
limits are set on its signal strength and cross section using the \CLs
method at \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level (cf.\
\Cref{sec:hypothesis_testing}). The exclusion limits are summarised
in~\Cref{tab:limits_non_resonant} separately for the \lephad and
\hadhad channels, and for the combination of all channels.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering

  \caption{Expected and observed upper limits on the the cross section
    of Higgs boson pair production via \ggF and VBF,
    $\sigma(pp \to HH)$, and the SM \HH ($gg$F+VBF) signal strength at
    \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level using the \CLs method. The
    expected limits are obtained under the assumption of $\mu =
    0$. Uncertainties on the SM prediction of $\sigma(pp \to \HH)$ are
    not considered when setting limits on the cross section
    directly.}%
  \label{tab:limits_non_resonant}

  % Workspaces: comb_2022_01_29
  \input{tables/non_res_limits}
\end{table}

The observed upper limit on the SM \HH signal strength is \num{4.7}
with an expectation of \num{3.9} for the combination of all channels.
The exclusion is largely driven by the high sensitivity of the \hadhad
channel to the SM \HH production, providing observed (expected)
exclusion limits on $\mu$ of \num{5.0} (\num{4.4}). Further discussion
and interpretation of these results will follow
in~\Cref{sec:result_discussion}.


\subsection{Results of the search for resonant production of $HH$}
\label{sec:results_res}

The search for resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via scalar
resonances is interpreted in terms of the cross section of
$pp \to X \to HH$. The interpretation is analogous to the approach
taken for the search for non-resonant SM \HH production, replacing the
BDT / NN discriminants with PNN discriminants evaluated at the $\mX$
hypothesis of interest. Moreover, the absence of SM Higgs boson pair
production is assumed for this interpretation.

The PNN discriminants in the signal region of the \hadhad channel are
shown for four exemplary mass points
in~\Cref{fig:resonant_mva_postfit} after the fit of the
background-only model to the observed data in all analysis channels.
Additionally, \Cref{tab:yields_postfit_resonant} depicts the expected
number of events after the fit in a signal-like region of the PNN
discriminant. Figures of the PNN discriminants for the \lephad SLT and
LTT channels are documented in~\Cref{sec:app_additional_figures}.
