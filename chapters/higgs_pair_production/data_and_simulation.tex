\section{Data and Simulated Event Samples}
\label{sec:data_and_simulation}

This search is performed using \pp-collision data at a centre of mass
energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$ collected by the ATLAS experiment
during \RunTwo of the LHC (2015--2018). All recorded events have to
pass the data quality criteria of the ATLAS
collaboration~\cite{DAPR-2018-01} requiring a fully operational
detector and stable beams at the LHC. The integrated luminosity of the
dataset of events passing the quality criteria corresponds to
\SI{139.0}{\ifb} with an uncertainty of
\SI{1.7}{\percent}~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-021}.
% as measured by LUCID~\cite{LUCID2}.
Events recorded by the ATLAS detector are reconstructed using the
\textsc{Athena} software suite~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001}.

Monte Carlo event generators are used to estimate the contributions of
signal and (most) background processes in regions entering this
search. The response of the ATLAS detector to generated events is
obtained either from a \emph{full simulation} of the
detector~\cite{SOFT-2010-01} based on \GEANT~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}
or from a hybrid approach relying on a parametric description of
calorimeter response~\cite{SOFT-2010-01} (\emph{fast simulation}). All
generated events are reconstructed from the detector response using
the same reconstruction algorithms used for \pp-collision data. The
effect of pile-up is accounted for by overlaying events with
additional inelastic \pp-collisions obtained from
simulation. Additionally, simulated events are re-weighted such that
the pile-up conditions match those observed in data.

In the following, a description of the simulated event samples used in
this analysis is given with a focus on the simulation of signal
processes. The Monte Carlo event generation setups for background
processes are summarised in~\Cref{tab:monte_carlo}.

Non-resonant production of SM \HH via \ggF is simulated using
\POWHEGBOX[v2]~\cite{Alioli:2010xd} at NLO (QCD) accounting for the
effects of the finite top-quark mass on real and virtual
corrections~\cite{Borowka:2016ehy,Baglio:2018lrj,Heinrich:2017kxx}.\footnote{As
  opposed to earlier calculations in the $m_{t} \to \infty$ limit
  using effective field theory approximations simplifying top-quark
  loops to effective couplings. See for example
  Refs.~\cite{Dawson:1998py} (NLO) and \cite{deFlorian:2013jea}
  (NNLO).} The generator uses the
\PDFforLHC[15nlo]~\cite{Butterworth:2015oua} set of PDFs and is
interfaced to \PYTHIA[8]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} with the A14 set of
tuned parameters~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} for the parton shower
and hadronisation. The sample of simulated events is normalised using
an inclusive $gg \to \HH$ cross section of \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} at
$\text{NNLO}_{\text{FTapprox}}$~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd}, which is a
combination of the full-theory prediction at NLO with additional NNLO
corrections derived in the heavy top-quark mass limit. The theoretical
uncertainties on the prediction is $^{+6\,\%}_{-23\,\%}$ from scale
variations and the top-quark mass scheme~\cite{Baglio:2020wgt} and
$\pm\SI{3}{\percent}$ from PDFs and $\alphas$~\cite{LHCHWGHH}.

Non-resonant production of SM \HH via VBF is simulated using
\MGNLO~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} % [2.7.3]
at LO (QCD) %~\cite{Bishara:2016kjn}
using the \NNPDF[3.0nlo] set of PDFs~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}. The matrix
element generator is interfaced to \PYTHIA[8] with the A14 tune for
parton showering and hadronisation. An inclusive cross section of
\SI{1.726}{\femto\barn}
at~$\text{N}^3\text{LO}$~\cite{Dreyer:2018qbw,LHCHWGHH} is used to
normalise the sample of generated events with theoretical
uncertainties of $^{+0.03\,\%}_{-0.04\,\%}$ from scale variations and
$\pm\SI{2.1}{\percent}$ from PDFs and $\alphas$~\cite{LHCHWGHH}.

Resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via massive scalar
resonances, $X$, produced in \ggF is simulated using \MGNLO at LO
(QCD) using the \NNPDF[2.3lo] set of PDFs~\cite{Ball:2012cx}. Twenty
generic benchmark signals are generated with resonance masses, \mX,
ranging from \SIrange{251}{1600}{\GeV} and with narrow widths of the
resonances ($\Gamma_{X} = \SI{10}{\MeV}$ in the event
generation). The interference with non-resonant SM \HH production is
neglected. The matrix element generator is interfaced to
\HERWIG[7.1]~\cite{Gieseke:2012ft,Bellm:2017jjp} with the default tune
for parton shower and hadronisation.
% Why narrow width? -> Broad resonances are very model dependent

Decays of hadrons containing $b$ and $c$ quarks are simulated using
\EVTGEN~\cite{Lange:2001uf} for all signal, top quark, and single
Higgs boson processes (cf.~\Cref{tab:monte_carlo}). By default,
\emph{full simulation} of the ATLAS detector is used for all processes
except for resonant \HH production with $\mX \leq \SI{1000}{\GeV}$ or
for samples generated with alternative generator setups for the
derivation of modelling uncertainties. In these cases \emph{fast
  simulation} is used instead.
