\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:event_selection}

The event selection focuses on selecting events consistent with
$\bbbar\lephad$ or $\bbbar\hadhad$ final states. The selection
criteria applied to events are kept as loose as possible\todo{It could
  be looser...} given the limitations imposed by the trigger
selection. Distinguishing between signal and background events based
on object- and event-level observables is not the primary goal of the
event selection but rather of a multivariate analysis that will be
introduced at a later stage (in \Cref{sec:multivariate_analysis}). In
addition, suitable control and validation regions are defined for the
purpose of estimating background processes or validating background
estimates using data recorded by the ATLAS detector.

Events considered for further analysis are required to fulfil basic
quality criteria independent of the analysis channel:
\begin{itemize}
  % GRL + basic checks

  % eventInfoIn->errorState(xAOD::EventInfo::EventFlagSubDet::Tile) == xAOD::EventInfo::Error
  % Problems in tile calorimeter (``tile corrupted events''')
  %
  % eventInfoIn->errorState(xAOD::EventInfo::EventFlagSubDet::LAr) == xAOD::EventInfo::Error
  % LAr noise bursts
  %
  % eventInfoIn->errorState(xAOD::EventInfo::EventFlagSubDet::SCT) == xAOD::EventInfo::Error
  % SCT corrupted events (``recovery period after single event upset''')
  %
  % eventInfoIn->isEventFlagBitSet(xAOD::EventInfo::Core,18
  % Event info missing after TTC restart
\item All events are required to fulfil the data quality criteria by
  the ATLAS collaboration~\cite{DAPR-2018-01} requiring stable beams
  at the LHC and a fully operational detector.

  % Has vertex
\item The event is required to have a primary vertex.

  % No fake jets
  % DFCommonJets_eventClean_LooseBad
\item Events containing one or more jets that are classified as originating
  from non-collision backgrounds or calorimeter noise according to a
  \emph{loose} jet cleaning~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-029} working point are
  rejected.
\end{itemize}

The search is divided into several analysis channels given by the
decay mode of the \taulepton pair and the type of trigger that
selected the event. The \lephad channel targets semi-leptonic decay
modes using single-lepton triggers (SLT) and lepton-plus-\tauhadvis
triggers (LTT). Each trigger category defines a corresponding
sub-channel, which are referred to as the \lephad SLT and \lephad LTT
channels. The \hadhad channel selects events with two \tauhadvis using
single-\tauhadvis triggers (STT) and di-\tauhadvis triggers
(DTT). While different types of triggers are used in the \hadhad
channel, the statistical analysis performed at a later stage will not
distinguish between events selected by STT and DTT, thus the \hadhad
final state is treated as a single analysis channel. In some cases,
for example for the background estimation, it will be required to
distinguish between both trigger categories. Cases where this applies
will be indicated explicitly.

Orthogonality between the \lephad and \hadhad channels is ensured by
the electron, muon, and \tauhadvis selections. In the \hadhad channel,
events are required to have exactly two \tauhadvis, vetoing events
with electrons or muons passing loose identification. Events in the
\lephad channels are required to have exactly one \tauhadvis and
exactly one electron or muon passing their respective loose
identification working point. Additionally, electrons (muons) are
required to pass the tight (medium) identification working point to
reduce backgrounds from jets being misidentified as electrons (muons).

Electrons, muons, and \tauhadvis have to be geometrically matched to
their corresponding objects at the HLT according to the trigger that
selected the event. Trigger-dependent transverse momentum thresholds
are applied to electrons, muons, and \tauhadvis to ensure that
triggers operate close to their trigger-efficiency plateau. The
thresholds applied in events selected by STT or SLT increased with
increasing instantaneous luminosity of the LHC during Run~2. In
contrast, lower \pT-thresholds on electrons, muons, and \tauhadvis
remained constant for DTT and LTT, trigger-rates instead being limited
by requiring additional jets and specific event topologies at the L1
trigger. The inclusion of the \lephad LTT channel allows to select
events with electrons or muons with transverse momenta below the SLT
\pT-threshold by requiring an additional \tauhadvis at
trigger-level. Orthogonality between the \lephad SLT and LTT channel
is ensured by only considering events with lepton \pT below the SLT
\pT-threshold for the LTT channel.

An overview of the signal region event selection for all search
channels is given in \Cref{tab:event_selection}. A more detailed
description of the \hadhad channel trigger selection will be given in
\Cref{sec:hadhad_trigger_selection}. Further selections applied at
event-level to define signal and control region will be summarised in
\Cref{sec:sr_and_cr_selection}.

Priority is given to STT events if the reconstructed \tauhad fulfil the
\pT-threshold of the trigger (\SI{100}{\GeV} for \verb|tau80|, \SI{140}{\GeV}
for \verb|tau125| and \SI{180}{\GeV} for \verb|tau160|) and are geometrically
matched to the HLT object that fired the trigger.

If the event does not fulfil the STT criteria, then the DTT is checked. The
\pT-thresholds for \tauhadvis is \SI{40}{\GeV} (\SI{30}{\GeV}) for the leading
(subleading) \tauhadvis candidate.

For three runs (336506, 336548, 336567) during 2017 data taking, L1Topo-based
triggers were mistakenly disabled in the trigger firmware also affecting the
\verb|L1DR-TAU20ITAU12I-J25| trigger. As a backup the almost unprescaled
\verb|HLT_tau35_medium1_tracktwo_tau25_medium1_tracktwo| trigger was used.

In 2017 / 2018 two different di-\tauhad triggers with different L1 seeds are
used. The L1 seeds are \verb|L1TAU20IM_2TAU12IM_4J12| and
\verb|L1TAU20IM_2TAU12IM_4J12.0ETA23| (4J12) and \verb|L1DR-TAU20ITAU12I-J25|
(L1Topo) and differ in the requirements on \tauhadvis and additional jets.

The 4J12 trigger requires two\footnote{Two \tauhadvis already satisfy 2J12}
additional jets at L1 with $\ET > \SI{12}{\GeV}$. Additionally, in 2018 the jets
are required to be in $|\eta| < 2.3$. The L1Topo trigger uses the ATLAS
topological trigger introduced in 2017 to require a $\Delta R(\tauhad, \tauhad)
< 2.8$ on both \tauhad as well as one additional jet with $\ET > \SI{25}{\GeV}$
at L1.

Orthogonality (and being on plateau of the trigger turn-on) between the 4J12 and
L1Topo trigger channel is ensured by offline cuts discussed in
Section.%~\ref{subsec:selhh_hadhad}.

During TS1 new \tauhadvis triggers employing RNN-based \tauhad identification
and MVA-based energy calibration were deployed. Starting from Period K, the
recommendation is to use a logical OR between the old
(\verb|medium1_tracktwoEF|) and new triggers (\verb|mediumRNN_tracktwoMVA|).

% TODO
\label{sec:reconstruction_of_higgs_candidates}


\subsubsection{Preselection}

Trigger selection follows \cref{sec:trigger}

\subsubsection{Signal Region}

The SR selection is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly two reconstructed \tauhadvis passing \textit{loose} identification
  (RNN)

\item Unit electric charge of \tauhadvis candidate with opposite sign as
  reconstructed from the tracks associated to the \tauhadvis candidates

\item Two or more jets

\item Exactly two \btagged jets with the \SI{77}{\percent} working point of the
  DL1r tagger

\item No reconstructed and identified electrons and muons in the event

\item Passing the trigger selection described in \cref{sec:trigger}

\item The \tauhadvis are geometrically matched to objects that fired either the
  STT or the DTT trigger.

\item \mMMC > \SI{60}{\GeV}

\item At least one \bjet with \pT > \SI{45}{\GeV} \todo{Can we drop this?}
\end{itemize}


Orthogonality between the L1Topo and the 4J12 DTT is ensured by offline cuts on
\tauhadvis and jet \pT:
\begin{itemize}
\item STT events: \tauhadvis are required to pass a trigger-dependent \pT
  threshold as described in \cref{sec:trigger}. STT events are prioritised over
  DTT events.

\item DTT events in 2015-2016: The leading jet is required to have \pT >
  \SI{80}{\GeV} due to the additional jet requirement (J25) at L1 in 2016. This
  ensures that the L1 trigger is close to its efficiency plateau, minimizing the
  impact of a mismatch in trigger efficiency in data / MC.

\item DTT events in 2017-2018: Are categorised into two categories depending on
  the triggers to be checked:\todo{Chris: need to check treatment of non-L1Topo
    trigger at the beginning of 2017}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If leading and subleading jet $\pT > \SI{45}{\GeV}$: Event is considered a
    4J12 event. This cut ensures that the additional jet requirement at L1 (J12)
    is fulfilled.
  \item Else if leading jet $\pT > \SI{80}{\GeV}$ and $\dRtautau \leq 2.5$:
    Event is considered a L1Topo event. The jet \pT and \dRtautau cut ensure
    that the additional J25 and \dRtautau requirement at L1 are fulfilled.
