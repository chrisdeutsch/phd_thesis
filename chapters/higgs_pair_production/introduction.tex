This chapter presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in
\bbtautau final states using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of
\pp-collision data recorded at the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of
the LHC. Non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs predicted by the
SM, hereafter referred to as SM \HH production, and resonant
production via scalar resonances of narrow width are considered in the
search. Decay modes of the pair of \tauleptons with two hadronic
\taulepton decays (\hadhad) and with one hadronic and one leptonic
\taulepton decay (\lephad) are targeted. These cover the majority of
decays of the \tautau system with fractions of
$\mathcal{B}(\tautau \to \hadhad) = \SI{42.0}{\percent}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(\tautau \to \lephad) =
\SI{45.6}{\percent}$~\cite{Zyla:2020zbs}. The $\taulep\taulep$ final
state with
$\mathcal{B}(\tautau \to \taulep\taulep) =
\SI{12.4}{\percent}$~\cite{Zyla:2020zbs} is not considered in this
search. The primary focus of this chapter lies on the \hadhad channel.

The $\HH \to \bbtautau$ search channel is among the most promising
channels to probe the nature of SM \HH production due to a substantial
fraction of \SI{7.3}{\percent} of decays of Higgs boson pairs to
\bbtautau final states (cf.~\Cref{fig:hh_branching_ratios}) and the
ability to exploit the distinct signature of \taulepton
decays. Previous searches in the \bbtautau channel have been performed
by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using data recorded during
Run~1~\cite{HIGG-2013-33,CMS-HIG-15-013} and at the beginning of Run~2
of the LHC~\cite{HIGG-2016-16-witherratum,CMS-HIG-17-002}. A context
for the results presented in this chapter is provided by other
searches for Higgs boson pair production by the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations using the \pp-collision dataset recorded during Run~2
of the LHC in the \bbtautau~\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-20-010},
\bbbb~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2022-035,CMS-HIG-20-005} and
\bbyy~\cite{HDBS-2018-34,CMS-HIG-19-018} channels. The work presented
here was partially published in Ref.~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-030} by the
ATLAS collaboration.

The aim of the search for SM \HH production, assuming no deviation
from the background-only hypothesis (i.e.\ no SM \HH production) is
observed, is to set upper limits on the strength and cross section of
a SM \HH signal produced either via the \ggF or VBF production
mode. Under the assumption of the SM, the size of the \pp-collision
dataset collected during Run~2 is not sufficient to obtain evidence
for SM \HH production. However, physics beyond the SM could enhance
the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs with kinematic
properties similar to those of the SM \HH signal which is being probed
in this search. Interpretations of the SM \HH search in terms of the
strength Higgs boson self-coupling are not subject of this chapter but
rather of \Cref{sec:higgs_self_coupling}. The search for resonant
production of Higgs boson pairs targets scalar resonances with masses
ranging from \SIrange{251}{1600}{\GeV} produced via \ggF and aims to,
in the absence of significant deviations from the SM expectation, set
upper limits on the production cross section of the scalar resonance.

This chapter is structured as follows. \Cref{sec:data_and_simulation}
describes the data and simulated event samples used for this
search. The reconstruction of physics objects and selection of events
is discussed in \Cref{sec:object_reconstruction,sec:event_selection},
respectively. The estimation of background processes contributing to
the search is described in \Cref{sec:background_estimation} with a
focus on the estimation of backgrounds with quark- or gluon-initiated
jets that are misidentified as \tauhadvis. The multivariate analysis
used to distinguish signal from background events is discussed in
\Cref{sec:multivariate_analysis}. Systematic uncertainties and the
statistical interpretation are described in
\Cref{sec:uncertainties,sec:statistical_analysis}. This chapter
concludes with a discussion of the results in
\Cref{sec:result_discussion} including a comparison with other
searches for Higgs boson pair production performed by the ATLAS and
CMS collaborations as well as an outlook on future prospects of SM \HH
searches at the High Luminosity LHC.
