This chapter describes the experimental environment surrounding the ATLAS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It serves to provide a context
for the development of algorithms for the identification of hadronic decays of
\tauleptons (\Cref{sec:tauid}) and searches for Higgs boson pair production
(\Cref{sec:dihiggs,sec:higgs_self_coupling}) at the ATLAS experiment. The
chapter is structured as follows. The LHC is introduced in \Cref{sec:lhc}
including important parameters of the machine. In \Cref{sec:atlas} the ATLAS
detector, one of two general-purpose particle detector experiments at the LHC,
is described. The chapter concludes in \Cref{sec:object_reco_at_atlas} by
summarising the techniques used to reconstruct particle collision events at the
LHC with the ATLAS detector.
