This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in final states
with two $b$-quarks and two \tauleptons using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of
\pp~collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the
LHC. Searches for Higgs boson pair production are instrumental in testing our
understanding of EWSB in the SM, allowing to directly probe the shape of the
Higgs potential---a fundamental component of the theory proposed by Brout,
Englert, and Higgs. These searches are challenging, however, since Higgs boson
pair production is three orders of magnitude less abundant than single Higgs
boson production at the LHC. Nevertheless, searches for Higgs boson pair
production are already of interest to probe the BSM sector. This is because the
presence of new physics could alter the non-resonant \HH production cross
section or introduce resonant enhancements of the cross section due to BSM
particles decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons.


The search for Higgs boson pair production in the \bbtautau channel considers
final states with one or two hadronic \taulepton decays. A particular focus is
put on the sub-channel with two hadronic \taulepton decays in this thesis. This
channel relies on the ability to efficiently identify \tauhadvis while
suppressing backgrounds from quark- or gluon-initiated jets. For this purpose, a
novel \tauid method is introduced that uses sequences of reconstructed
charged-particle tracks and topo-clusters in the calorimeters, as well as
high-level information about \tauhadvis candidates, as inputs. This is made
possible by the use of a RNN architecture that allows to process variable-length
sequences. This method significantly improves the \tauid performance over the
BDT-based algorithm previously used at the ATLAS experiment. At fixed \tauhadvis
efficiency working points, the RNN-based \tauid improves the rejection of
\faketauhadvis from quark- or gluon-initiated jets by \SI{80}{\percent}
(\SIrange{40}{80}{\percent}) for 1-prong (3-prong) \tauhadvis
candidates. Moreover, the improvement in \faketauhadvis rejection exceeds
\SI{100}{\percent} for candidates with $\pT > \SI{70}{\GeV}$. The RNN-based
\tauid was adopted by the ATLAS collaboration as the recommended \tauid
algorithm for analyses of the Run~2 \pp~collision dataset. Furthermore, it was
adapted for the use in \tauhadvis-triggers for data-taking at the end of Run~2
and the beginning of Run~3 of the LHC.


A search for scalar, narrow-width resonances with masses between
\num{251}~and~\SI{1600}{\GeV} decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons is
presented. The \bbtautau channel provides competitive upper limits on the
resonant \HH production cross section in a mass range of
\SIrange{375}{800}{\GeV}. Over this range, the upper limits on the
$pp \to X \to \HH$ cross section range from \SIrange{130}{30}{\femto\barn} at
\SI{95}{\percent}~CL. The largest excess in the search is observed for
$\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$ with a local (global) significance of $3.1\sigma$
($2.0\sigma$). The excess is not statistically significant given the
conventional significance thresholds for the discovery of new physics. In
addition, it is not supported by other search channels of the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations, which set more stringent upper limits for
$\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$.


A search for SM~\HH production via \ggF and VBF is performed. No statistically
significant signal is observed in the search; therefore, upper limits are set on
the SM~\HH signal strength and production cross section. The observed (expected)
upper limit at \SI{95}{\percent}~CL on the SM~\HH signal strength is 4.7 (3.9).
The observed (expected) upper limit at \SI{95}{\percent}~CL on the SM~\HH
production cross section is \SI{140}{\femto\barn} (\SI{110}{\femto\barn}). The
search for SM~\HH production in the \bbtautau channel that is presented in this
thesis provides the highest expected sensitivity to SM~\HH production of any
single channel to date.


Finally, the search for SM~\HH production is reinterpreted in terms of
non-resonant \HH production with anomalous values of the Higgs boson
self-coupling constant. Upper limits at \SI{95}{\percent}~CL are set on the
cross section of non-resonant \HH production for different hypothesised values
of \klambda. Based on the observed (expected) upper limits on the cross section,
\klambda is constrained to be within $-2.4 \leq \klambda \leq 9.2$
($-2.0 \leq \klambda \leq 9.0$).

The most stringent upper limits on SM~\HH production are provided by the
combiantion of the most sensitive channels by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations
yielding observed upper limits of 2.4 and 3.4 times the SM expectation,
respectively~\cite{}.



Under the SM assumption, the first observation of SM~\HH production possible at
the HL-LHC. Moreover, the Higgs boson self-coupling. Therefore, searches for
Higgs boson pair production remain an important part of future physics
programmes...




\vspace{10em}\noindent\textbf{Notes:}\\

In~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-046} the HL-LHC prospects claim to set an
upper limit of $4.3 \times \sigma_\text{SM}$. 6 years later we already
exceed this prospect.
