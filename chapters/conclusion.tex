This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in final states
with two $b$-quarks and two \tauleptons using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of
\pp~collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the
LHC. Searches for Higgs boson pair production are instrumental in testing our
understanding of EWSB in the SM, allowing to directly probe the shape of the
Higgs potential---a fundamental component of the theory proposed by Brout,
Englert, and Higgs. These searches are challenging, however, since Higgs boson
pair production is three orders of magnitude less abundant than single Higgs
boson production at the LHC. Nevertheless, searches for Higgs boson pair
production are already of interest to probe the BSM sector. This is because the
presence of new physics could alter the non-resonant \HH production cross
section or introduce resonant enhancements of the cross section due to BSM
particles decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons.


The search for Higgs boson pair production in the \bbtautau channel considers
final states with one or two hadronic \taulepton decays. A particular focus is
put on the sub-channel with two hadronic \taulepton decays in this thesis. This
channel relies on the ability to efficiently identify \tauhadvis while
suppressing backgrounds from quark- or gluon-initiated jets. For this purpose, a
novel \tauid method is introduced that uses sequences of reconstructed
charged-particle tracks and topo-clusters in the calorimeters, as well as
high-level information about \tauhadvis candidates, as inputs. This is made
possible by the use of a RNN architecture that allows to process variable-length
sequences. This method significantly improves the \tauid performance over the
BDT-based algorithm previously used by the ATLAS collaboration. At fixed
\tauhadvis efficiency working points, the RNN-based \tauid improves the
rejection of \faketauhadvis from quark- or gluon-initiated jets by
\SI{80}{\percent} (\SIrange{40}{80}{\percent}) for 1-prong (3-prong) \tauhadvis
candidates. Moreover, the improvement in \faketauhadvis rejection exceeds
\SI{100}{\percent} for candidates with $\pT > \SI{70}{\GeV}$. The RNN-based
\tauid was adopted by the ATLAS collaboration as the recommended \tauid
algorithm for analyses of the Run~2 \pp~collision dataset. Furthermore, it was
adapted for the use in \tauhadvis-triggers for data-taking at the end of Run~2
and the beginning of Run~3 of the LHC.


A search for scalar, narrow-width resonances with masses between
\num{251}~and~\SI{1600}{\GeV} decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons is presented
in this thesis. The search in the \bbtautau channel provides competitive upper
limits on the resonant \HH production cross section in a mass range of
\SIrange{375}{800}{\GeV}. Over this range, the upper limits on the cross section
of $pp \to X \to \HH$ range from \SIrange{130}{30}{\femto\barn} at
\SI{95}{\percent}~CL. The largest excess in the search is observed for
$\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$ with a local (global) significance of $3.1\sigma$
($2.0\sigma$). The excess is not statistically significant given the
conventional significance thresholds for the discovery of new physics. In
addition, it is not supported by other search channels of the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations, which set more stringent upper limits for
$\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$.


The non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs predicted by the SM cannot be
established given the size of the \pp~collision datasets collected during Run~2
of the LHC. In this thesis a search for SM~\HH production via \ggF and VBF is
presented. No statistically significant signal contribution is
observed. Therefore, upper limits are set on the SM~\HH signal strength and
production cross section, yielding upper limits of
\begin{align*}
  &\mu  < 4.7 \, \text{(observed)} && \mu < 3.9\,\text{(expected)}
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
  &\xsecggfvbf < \SI{140}{\femto\barn} \,\text{(observed)} && \xsecggfvbf < \SI{110}{\femto\barn} \,\text{(expected)}
\end{align*}
at \SI{95}{\percent}~CL, where the expected upper limits are derived under the
background-only hypothesis. The \bbtautau channel provides the highest expected
sensitivity to SM~\HH production of any single channel to date.

Finally, the search for SM~\HH production is reinterpreted to set upper limits
on the non-resonant \HH production cross sections for anomalous values of the
Higgs boson self-coupling constant.
in the context of
anomalous values of the Higgs boson self-coupling. Upper limits are set on the
cross section of non-resonant \HH production for different hypothesised values
of \klambda. Based on the cross section upper limits, \klambda is constrained to
be within
\begin{align*}
  &-2.4 \leq \klambda \leq 9.2 \,\text{(observed)} && -2.0 \leq \klambda \leq 9.0 \,\text{(expected)} \,\text{.}
\end{align*}

Therefore, searches for Higgs boson pair production remain an important part of
future physics programmes...


\vspace{10em}\noindent\textbf{Notes:}\\

In~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-046} the HL-LHC prospects claim to set an
upper limit of $4.3 \times \sigma_\text{SM}$. 6 years later we already
exceed this prospect.
