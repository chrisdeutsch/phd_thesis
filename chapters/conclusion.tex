This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in final states
with two $b$~quarks and two \tauleptons using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of
\pp~collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the
LHC. Searches for Higgs boson pair production are instrumental in testing our
understanding the EWSB in the SM. Specifically, searches for non-resonant Higgs
boson pair production directly probe the shape of the Higgs potential--a
fundamental ingredient in the theory proposed by Brout, Englert, Higgs and
others.

% three orders of magnitude smaller than single Higgs boson production.

% However, the Higgs boson pair production cross section predicted by the SM is
% very small, about 1000 times smaller than single Higgs boson production,
% making this a challenging task.


% BSM physics can affect non-resonant through effective couplings and resonant
% through direct production of new particles.



% Focus was on the \hadhad channel.

% Tau-ID
%
% Novel \tauid method using sequences of charged-particle tracks and
% topo-clusters in the calorimeters associated to \tauhadvis candidates as
% inputs and combining with high-level information. Using RNN architecture.
%
% Significant improvement over the previously used method employing BDTs and
% only high-level information. At fixed \tauhadvis efficiency working points,
% the RNN improves the rejection of \tauhadvis candidates originating from
% quark- or gluon-jets by \SI{80}{\percent} (\SIrange{40}{80}{\percent}) for
% 1-prong (3-prong) \tauhadvis candidates. In some scenarios (high pt) the
% rejection compared to the previously used method is doubled.
%
%
% Adopted as the standard technique for \tauid during
%
% In addition, the technique was/is employed for \tauid at the HLT and is
% continued to be used for triggers at the beginning of Run~3 of the LHC.

% Higgs boson pair production (resonant)
%
% scalar, narrow-width resonances in a mass range from \SIrange{251}{1600}{\GeV}
%
% the \bbtautau channel yields the largest expected sensitivity of any ATLAS
% analysis to Higgs boson pair production via resonances in a mass range from
% \SIrange{375}{800}{\GeV}
%
% In this range
%
% Broad excess for resonance masses around $\mX = \SI{1000}{\GeV}$ with a local
% (global) significance of $3.1\sigma$ ($2.0\sigma$). Not found to be
% statistically significant and also not confirmed by other experiments.

% Higgs boson pair production (non-resonant)
% SM limit + klambda

% SM Limit:
%
% So far, no sign of SM~\HH production (SM predicts xsec of about 32.7fb)
%
% mu limit: 4.7 (3.9) times the SM prediction for SM~\HH production
%
% xsec limit: 140 (110) fb
%
% Single channel with the largest expected sensitivity to date.
%
%
%
% Reinterpreted in terms of anomalous \klambda
%
% \klambda is constrained to be within
% $-2.4 \leq \klambda \leq 9.2$ (obs)
% $-2.0 \leq \klambda \leq 9.0$ (exp for bkg.\ only)

\vspace{10em}

In~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-046} the HL-LHC prospects claim to set an
upper limit of $4.3 \times \sigma_\text{SM}$. 6 years later we already
exceed this prospect.
