\section{Experimental Status of Searches for Higgs Boson Pair Production}%
\label{seq:experimental_status}

The following summarises the experimental status of searches for Higgs boson
pair production prior to the work performed as part of this thesis. The focus
lies on results of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations obtained using \pp-collision
datasets at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$ from the 2015 and 2016 runs of the LHC.

% The results obtained as part of this thesis will be compared to results of both
% collaborations using the \pp-collision datasets recorded from 2015 to 2018 at
% the LHC at a later point.


\subsection{Searches for SM Higgs Boson Pair Production}%
\label{sec:past_results_smhh}

% https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-17-030/index.html

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations set upper limits on the cross-section of SM \HH
production via \ggF, $\sigma_{\ggF}$, at \SI{95}{\percent} CL. The results of
both collaborations are summarised in \Cref{fig:prior_status_smhh}. Searches for
SM \HH production were performed in a variety of channels, the \bbbb, \bbtautau,
and \bbyy channels being the most sensitive ones. Since these three channels
yielded comparable upper limits, a statistical combination of SM \HH searches
was performed by both collaborations. The observed (expected) upper limits on
$\sigma_{\ggF} / \sigma_{\ggF}^{\text{SM}}$ of the combination are $6.9$ ($10$)
and $22.2$ ($12.8$) ATLAS and CMS collaboration,
respectively~\cite{HDBS-2018-58,CMS-HIG-17-030}. At the time of publication,
these were the most stringent limits on SM \HH production.

    limits are normalised to a SM cross-section prediction of
    $\sigma_{\ggF} = \SI{33.5}{\femto\barn}$ and given separately for individual
    search channels and the statistical combination of all listed channels. In
    both cases, the expected limits are derived under the background-only
    hypothesis (i.e.\ no SM \HH production). The results are based on
    \pp-collision data taken at the beginning of Run~2 of the LHC.}%

\subsection{Constraints on the Trilinear Higgs Boson Self-Coupling}%
\label{sec:past_results_klambda}

The searches for SM \HH production in \Cref{sec:past_results_smhh} are
reinterpreted in the context of anomalous values of the trilinear Higgs boson
self-coupling. Upper limits are set on the cross-section of non-resonant \HH
production as a function of \klambda.

    CMS (b) collaborations. The expected upper limits are obtained under the
    background-only assumption (i.e.\ no non-resonant \HH production). Values of
    \klambda where the theoretical prediction exceeds the upper limit are
    excluded by the measurements.}%
