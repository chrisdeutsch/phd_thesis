\begin{description}

\item[Vacuum Stability] The present minimum with a vacuum expectation
  value of $v \approx \si{246}{\GeV}$ might be either a global minimum
  in which case the universe is stable or only a local minimum which
  leads to a metastable universe. In the metastable case, the state of
  the Higgs field could tunnel to a new local or global minimum with a
  smaller vacuum expectation value. Current experimental data cannot
  distinguish whether the universe is stable or
  meta-stable\todo{citation}.

\item[Elektroweak phase transition] In baryogenesis a first order
  electroweak phase transition is needed.

  Higgs? 2HDM}

\todo[inline]{Mention Spin-2 resonances? KK-graviton -- theoretically not favoured}

% \item[BSM] Radions, 2HDM, Warped extra dimensions, composite Higgs, hMSSM, KK
%   Gravitons: Most could decay to pairs of SM Higgs bosons.
