The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the most precisely tested
theories. It is a relatistivic quantum field theory using the Lagrange
formalism.

It provides a unified description of three of the four forces of nature: the
electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong
interaction. Gravitation not included.

In this thesis, both SI and natural units ($\hbar = c = \varepsilon_0 = 1$) are
used, whichever is most suitable in a given context. In addition, this chapter
adopts the Einstein summation convention implying summation over repeated
indices in a given mathematical term. Greek indices represent the four
dimensions of space-time, while the meaning of latin indices depends on the
context. Finally, the metric tensor of special relativity is assumed to follow
the sign convention $\eta = \diag(+1, -1, -1, -1)$.

The following summary of the theoretical foundation, particularly
\Cref{sec:sm_overview,sec:theo_symmetries_interactions}, is based on
Refs.~\cite{Halzen:1984mc,Thomson:2013zua,Djouadi:2005gi}.
