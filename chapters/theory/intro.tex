The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the most precisely tested
theories. It is a relatistivic quantum field theory using the Lagrange
formalism.

It provides a unified description of three of the four forces of nature: the
electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong
interaction. Gravitation not included.

Natural units $\hbar = c = 1$. Can be recovered by dimensional
analysis. Heaviside--Lorentz units?

Einstein summation convention: Sum over repeated indices.

Space-time indices are given as greek letters. All other indices are latin.

The sign convention of the metric is $(+, -, -, -)$ (conventional in PP).
