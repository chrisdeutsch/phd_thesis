% Contents of the thesis

For millenia humankind has attempted to understand the universe and the laws
that govern it. The nature of the universe was already debated by the ancient
philosophers who eventually postulated that all matter consists of fundamental
building blocks referred to as \emph{atoms}, derived from the Greek Ã¡tomos
meaning indivisible. This concept was adopted in the 19\textsuperscript{th}
century to develop the atomic theory leading to the concept known today as
\emph{the atom}. It turned out, however, that this term is a misnomer when the
atom was found to be composed of electrons and a massive nucleus. With the
ability to probe increasingly smaller length scales in scattering experiments of
the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, it was found that the nucleus itself is
composed of nucleons, which in turn consist of bound systems of quarks.

The Standard Model of particle physics

Unification of the electromagnetic and weak interaction by Glashow, Salam, and
Weinberg~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq}. The Standard Model
is built on the assumption of a fundamental symmetry, referred to as local gauge
invariance, which

A point of tension was the non-vanishing mass of the gauge bosons of the weak
interaction which would violate the fundamental symmetries

the Higgs mechanism.

In 2012, first experimental evidence of a new boson with a mass of about
\SI{125}{\GeV} was established by the ATLAS~\cite{HIGG-2012-27} and
CMS~\cite{CMS-HIG-12-028} collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider of CERN.

theory of electroweak unification by Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg



Our current understanding of physics at the subatomic scale originates from the
20\textsuperscript{th} century. Quarks and leptons are now viewed as the
fundamental building blocks of matter, their interactions being mediated by the
exchange of particles referred to as \emph{gauge bosons}.

The Standard Model of particle physics, formulated in the 1970s, provides the
framework to describe the elementary particles.

Notes from chat with Jochen:
\begin{itemize}

\item Keep it short \ra about 120 pages
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SM about 15 pages and focus on \HH production

  \item LHC and ATLAS experiment about 10 pages: For every detector
    component a picture and a paragraph

  \item Experimental methods: 10 pages

  \item Try to keep it way below 160 pages???
  \end{itemize}

\item Cut out or move less interesting things to the backup

\item Make it more interesting! Cut out repetition...

\end{itemize}
