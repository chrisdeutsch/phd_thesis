% Contents of the thesis

The turn of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century marked the origin of modern
physics, ushering in a century of remarkable advancements in our understanding
of fundamental physics. Key to this success was the development of the
\emph{theory of special relativity} and the rise of \emph{quantum mechanics}. On
the one hand, the theory of special relativity, proposed by Einstein in
1905~\cite{einstein:1905zedbk,einstein:1905idtekvsea}, allowed to describe
physical systems with energies much larger than the energy of the system at
rest. On the other hand, the introduction of quantum mechanics was instrumental
in describing phenomena occurring at length scales of atomic and sub-atomic
physics. The field of (high-energy) particle physics is situated at the
intersection of special relativity and quantum mechanics, probing the nature of
elementary particles and their interactions at large energy scales.
% Nowadays, a cornerstone of the field are particle collider experiments (energy
% frontier).

The \emph{Standard Model} (SM) is at the centre of particle physics, combining
special relativity and quantum mechanics in a paradigm known as a
\emph{relativistic quantum field theory}. It describes the currently known
elementary particles and three (out of four) fundamental forces of nature.  The
formulation of the SM traces back to the 1970s, consolidating the theory of the
strong interaction\todo{Citations?} and the Glashow--Salam--Weinberg (GSW) model
of the electroweak
interaction~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq} in a single
theory.

SM is great and no fundamental changes have been made since its inception.

% For millenia humankind has attempted to understand the universe and the laws
% that govern it. The nature of the universe was already debated by the ancient
% philosophers who eventually postulated that all matter consists of fundamental
% building blocks referred to as \emph{atoms}, derived from the Greek Ã¡tomos
% meaning indivisible. This concept was adopted in the 19\textsuperscript{th}
% century to develop the atomic theory leading to the concept known today as
% \emph{the atom}. It turned out, however, that this term is a misnomer when the
% atom was found to be composed of electrons and a massive nucleus. With the
% ability to probe increasingly smaller length scales in scattering experiments of
% the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, it was found that the nucleus itself is
% composed of nucleons, which in turn consist of bound systems of quarks.

The Standard Model of particle physics

Unification of the electromagnetic and weak interaction by Glashow, Salam, and
Weinberg~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq}. The Standard Model
is built on the assumption of a fundamental symmetry, referred to as local gauge
invariance, which

A point of tension was the non-vanishing mass of the gauge bosons of the weak
interaction which would violate the fundamental symmetries

acquire mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking in a mechanism now known as
the Higgs mechanism.




In 2012, first experimental evidence of a new boson with a mass of about
\SI{125}{\GeV} was established by the ATLAS~\cite{HIGG-2012-27} and
CMS~\cite{CMS-HIG-12-028} collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider of CERN.

Our current understanding of physics at the subatomic scale originates from the
20\textsuperscript{th} century. Quarks and leptons are now viewed as the
fundamental building blocks of matter, their interactions being mediated by the
exchange of particles referred to as \emph{gauge bosons}.

The Standard Model of particle physics, formulated in the 1970s, provides the
framework to describe the elementary particles.

This thesis is structured as follows: \Cref{sec:standard_model} lays the
foundation for searches for Higgs boson pair production. The SM is summarised,
and the role of electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs boson in the SM is
illustrated. Moreover, the phenomenology of the Higgs boson and Higgs boson pair
production is discussed in the context of the SM and theories beyond the SM. The
chapter concludes with a summary of experimental results on searches for Higgs
boson pair production prior to the work presented in this thesis.
\Cref{sec:atlas_and_lhc} describes the Large Hadron Collider, the ATLAS
experiment, and the techniques used to reconstruct particle collision events
with the ATLAS detector. The collision events recorded by the ATLAS detector are
analysed using a suite of statistical methods that are introduced in
\Cref{sec:experimental_methods}.

The main part of this thesis is concerned with searches for Higgs boson pair
production in final states with two $b$-quarks and two hadronically decaying
\tauleptons ($\tau^{-} \to \text{hadrons} + \nu_\tau$). A crucial element of
these searches is the ability to reconstruct and identify hadronic \taulepton
decays.\todo{Why?} A novel method of performing \tauid using neural networks is
introduced in \Cref{sec:tauid}. This method is subsequently used in
\Cref{sec:dihiggs} to perform searches for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson
pair production using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of proton--proton collision data
collected at the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the Large Hadron Collider. In
\Cref{sec:higgs_self_coupling} the results of \Cref{sec:dihiggs} are
re-interpreted to set constraints on the possible values of the strength of the
Higgs boson self-coupling. The thesis is concluded in \Cref{sec:conclusion}.

Notes from chat with Jochen:
\begin{itemize}

\item Keep it short \ra about 120 pages
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SM about 15 pages and focus on \HH production

  \item LHC and ATLAS experiment about 10 pages: For every detector
    component a picture and a paragraph

  \item Experimental methods: 10 pages

  \item Try to keep it way below 160 pages???
  \end{itemize}

\item Cut out or move less interesting things to the backup

\item Make it more interesting! Cut out repetition...
