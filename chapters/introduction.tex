The turn of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century marked the origin of modern
physics, ushering in a century of remarkable advancements in fundamental
physics. Key to this success was the development of the \emph{theory of special
  relativity} and the rise of \emph{quantum mechanics}. On the one hand, the
theory of special relativity
% , proposed by Einstein in 1905~\cite{einstein:1905zedbk,einstein:1905idtekvsea},
allowed to describe physical systems with energies much larger than the energy
of the system at rest. On the other hand, the introduction of quantum mechanics
was instrumental in describing phenomena occurring at length scales of atomic
and sub-atomic physics. The field of (high-energy) particle physics is situated
at the intersection of special relativity and quantum mechanics, probing the
nature of elementary particles and their interactions at the largest energy
scales experimentally accessible.
% Nowadays, a cornerstone of the field are particle collider experiments (energy
% frontier).

The \emph{Standard Model} (SM) is the theory at the centre of particle physics,
combining special relativity and quantum mechanics in a paradigm known as a
\emph{relativistic quantum field theory}. It describes the currently known
elementary particles and three (out of four) fundamental forces of nature. The
formulation of the SM traces back to the 1970s, when the theory of the strong
interaction~\cite{Fritzsch:1973pi,Gross:1973id,Politzer:1973fx}\todo{Check me!}
and the Glashow--Salam--Weinberg (GSW)
model~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq} of the electroweak
interaction were consolidated in a single theory. Since then, the SM had
tremendous success in describing the properties of elementary particles and
their interactions, and notably in predicting the existence of several
elementary particles before their experimental discovery. Among the predicted
particles is the \emph{Higgs boson}, which was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS
and CMS experiments~\cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028} at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The Higgs boson arises as part of the Brout--Englert--Higgs
(BEH) mechanism~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964pj}
% \todo{Is BEH technically only for gauge boson masses?}
that is employed in the SM to explain how elementary
particles acquire mass in a process referred to \emph{electroweak symmetry
  breaking} (EWSB).
% \todo{Say that EWSB occurred shortly after the Big Bang
% ($10^{-12}\,\si{\second}$)?}
%
% \footnote{The details of the mass generation process differ between gauge
% bosons and fermions. These differences are discussed in
% \Cref{sec:standard_model}.}
%
% While the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its properties
% lends confidence in the SM, further tests of the nature of the Higgs boson are
% required.

% SM: no fundamental changes have been made since its inception. (conceptually
% the same since then.)

In the SM, the Higgs boson is predicted to interact with itself--a property
referred to as the Higgs boson self-coupling. The strength of the self-coupling
is determined by the shape of the Higgs potential, a central component of the
BEH mechanism that is responsible for inducing the process of EWSB.
% This self-coupling is a result of the BEH mechanism, and its strength is
% directly related to the shape of the Higgs potential. The choice of Higgs
% potential is central to the BEH mechanism in the SM as it induces the process
% of EWSB that is instrumental in generating the masses of elementary particles.
Therefore, direct measurements of the Higgs boson self-coupling are instrumental
to test our understanding of EWSB in the SM. These measurements can be performed
using high-energy particle collision events, such as the ones occuring at the
LHC, that result in the production of pairs of Higgs bosons. Higgs boson pair
production is an exceedingly rare process, for which experimental evidence has
yet to be established.

% Should start with: Higgs boson pair production
% Or with new physics?
%
% To better connect to the previous paragraph?
%
% The phenomenology of Higgs boson pair production might be altered by
% contributions of new physics. While the SM can be seen as an effective theory
% in many regards, it is known to be incomplete as it leaves a number of
% phenomena (e.g.\ gravitation, dark matter, etc.) unexplained.
The SM is an effective theory in many regards, however, it is known to be
incomplete as it leaves a number of phenomena (e.g.\ gravitation, dark matter,
etc.) unexplained. Eventually, these shortcomings have to be addressed,
requiring a theory that goes beyond the SM (BSM). The phenomenology of Higgs
boson pair production in BSM theories might differ significantly from the SM.
For example, Higgs boson pair production could occur via new massive resonances,
or BSM physics could alter the (effective) strength of the Higgs boson
self-coupling. The presence of such signatures would be indiciative of new
physics, thus making searches for Higgs boson pair production an important probe
of the BSM sector.

% BSM theories often introduce new particles/interactions, possibly altering the
% phenomenology of Higgs boson pair production.  Among these are models
% predicting Higgs boson pair production via new massive resonances, or models
% leading to an apparent change in the Higgs boson self-coupling strength
% through radiative corrections.

This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in final states
with two $b$-quarks and two \tauleptons ($HH \to \bbtautau$). The search is
performed using data of proton--proton (\pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass
energy of \SI{13}{\TeV} recorded by the ATLAS detector during Run~2 of the
LHC. The data were collected by the ATLAS collaboration over a period spanning
from 2015 to 2018, yielding a dataset with an integrated luminosity of
\SI{139}{\per\femto\barn}. Two channels are considered in the search: the
\hadhad channel targeting events with two hadronic \taulepton
decays,\footnote{In the parlance of particle physics, decays of the form
  $\tau^- \to \text{hadrons} + \nu_\tau$ are referred to as a hadronic
  \taulepton decays (\tauhad), and $\tau^- \to \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell \nu_\tau$
  for $\ell = e$ or $\mu$ as leptonic \taulepton decays (\taulep).} and the
\lephad channel targeting events with one leptonic and one hadronic \taulepton
decay. Three different signatures of Higgs boson pair production are considered:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs as predicted by the SM (SM
  \HH production).

\item Production of Higgs boson pairs via intermediate scalar resonances
  (resonant \HH production).
  % Such processes are not predicted by the SM but can arise in a multitude of
  % models with physics beyond the SM (BSM), for example in models with extended
  % Higgs sectors.

\item Non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs with anomalous values of the
  Higgs boson self-coupling constant.

\end{enumerate}
The latter two signatures only arise in models involving physics beyond the SM
(BSM).


% The latter two scenarios


% - Searching for SM \HH production

% - Searching for resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in scenarios involving
% physics beyond the SM (BSM)

% - Setting constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling

% - Tau identification: Novel machine learning


% The focus of this thesis is on the \hadhad channel.

This thesis is structured as follows: \Cref{sec:standard_model} lays the
foundation for searches for Higgs boson pair production. The SM is summarised,
and the role of electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs boson in the SM is
illustrated. Moreover, the phenomenology of the Higgs boson and Higgs boson pair
production is discussed in the context of the SM and theories beyond the SM. The
chapter concludes with a summary of experimental results on searches for Higgs
boson pair production prior to the work presented in this thesis.
\Cref{sec:atlas_and_lhc} describes the Large Hadron Collider, the ATLAS
experiment, and the techniques used to reconstruct particle collision events
with the ATLAS detector. The collision events recorded by the ATLAS detector are
analysed using a suite of statistical methods that are introduced in
\Cref{sec:experimental_methods}.

The main part of this thesis is concerned with searches for Higgs boson pair
production in final states with two $b$-quarks and two hadronically decaying
\tauleptons ($\tau^{-} \to \text{hadrons} + \nu_\tau$). A crucial element of
these searches is the ability to reconstruct and identify hadronic \taulepton
decays.\todo{Why?} A novel method of performing \tauid using neural networks is
introduced in \Cref{sec:tauid}. This method is subsequently used in
\Cref{sec:dihiggs} to perform searches for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson
pair production using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of proton--proton collision data
collected at the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the Large Hadron Collider. In
\Cref{sec:higgs_self_coupling} the results of \Cref{sec:dihiggs} are
re-interpreted to set constraints on the possible values of the strength of the
Higgs boson self-coupling. The thesis is concluded in \Cref{sec:conclusion}.
