% Why study particle physics
% - Study of natural phenomena / what laws govern the universe?
% - Study matter and radiation, and its dynamics across space and time
% - Where do we come from where do we go?
% - Matter and radiation
% - Particle collider experiments reproduce the conditions of the universe


% Modern particle physics born in the 20th century: The Standard Model
% - First collider experiments
% - In its current form developed in the 1960s
% - Modern particle physics -> QFT

% The Higgs boson

% Contents of the thesis

The study of the universe and the laws that govern it have been performed for
millennia.

An an endeavour already pursued for milennia.

Current model: Big bang, general relativity, Standard Model

% Big bang

The Standard Model of particle physics described in its current form in the
1960s by Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg.


With the completion of the Standard Model of particle physics as it is known
today in the 1960s

The Higgs field and the corresponding excitation, the Higgs boson, postulated in
the 1960s

\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964pj}


Postulated in the 1960s as part of the Higgs mechanism allowing for massive
gauge bosons while maintaining the fundamental symmetries the Standard Model of
physics is built upon.


-> Mass terms for W/Z first break local gauge invariance and second lead to
infinities that cannot be renormalised.

-> Mass generation via spontaneous symmetry breaking


. After searches spanning multiple decades at the Large Electron
Positron Collider and the Tevatron,

After a search spanning multiple decades, the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012
by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

later awarded the Nobel Prize


Two parameters describe the Higgs potential: $m_{H}$ and $v$ (or $\mu$ and
$\lambda$)

After decades of searches at tevatron, lep, etc....

Discovery of a boson \cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028} in 2012

Higgs boson discovery



The standard model one of the most precisely tested theories...

Stood up to scrutiny, thus far fulfilling all the predictions made by the SM.

Quantum numbers, Mass measurement

What is not yet tested? (While predicted by the SM)
- Higgs boson coupling to electrons/muons
- Higgs boson coupling to charm- and lighter quarks
- Trilinear self-coupling


Couplings: Z, W, top, bottom, tau, muon (evidence)

Notes from chat with Jochen:
\begin{itemize}

\item Keep it short \ra about 120 pages
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SM about 15 pages and focus on \HH production

  \item LHC and ATLAS experiment about 10 pages: For every detector
    component a picture and a paragraph

  \item Experimental methods: 10 pages

  \item Try to keep it way below 160 pages???
  \end{itemize}

\item Cut out or move less interesting things to the backup

\item Make it more interesting! Cut out repetition...

\end{itemize}
