% Why study particle physics
% - Study of natural phenomena / what laws govern the universe?
% - Study matter and radiation, and its dynamics across space and time
% - Where do we come from where do we go?
% - Matter and radiation
% - Particle collider experiments reproduce the conditions of the universe

The turn of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century marked the origin of modern
physics, ushering in a century of remarkable advancements in our understanding
of fundamental physics. Key to this success was the development of the
\emph{theory of special relativity} and the rise of \emph{quantum mechanics}. On
the one hand, the theory of special relativity, proposed by Einstein in
1905~\cite{einstein:1905zedbk,einstein:1905idtekvsea}, allowed to describe
physical systems with energies much larger than the energy of the system at
rest. On the other hand, the introduction of quantum mechanics was instrumental
in describing phenomena occurring at length scales of atomic and sub-atomic
physics. The field of (high-energy) particle physics is situated at the
intersection of special relativity and quantum mechanics, probing the nature of
elementary particles and their interactions at large energy scales.
% Nowadays, a cornerstone of the field are particle collider experiments (energy
% frontier).

The \emph{Standard Model} (SM) is the theory at the centre of particle physics,
combining special relativity and quantum mechanics in a paradigm known as a
\emph{relativistic quantum field theory}. It describes the currently known
elementary particles and three (out of four) fundamental forces of nature. The
formulation of the SM traces back to the 1970s, when the theory of the strong
interaction\todo{Citations?} and the Glashow--Salam--Weinberg (GSW)
model~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq} of the electroweak
interaction were consolidated in a single theory. Since then, the SM had
tremendous success in describing the properties of elementary particles and
their interactions, and notably in predicting the existence of several
elementary particles before their experimental discovery. Among the predicted
particles is the \emph{Higgs boson}, which was discovered in
2012~\cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028} by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Higgs boson arises as part of the
Brout--Englert--Higgs (BEH) mechanism~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964pj}, a
mechanism employed in the SM to explain how elementary particles can acquire
mass.

After searches spanning multiple decades at the Large Electron Positron Collider
and the Tevatron,

After a search spanning multiple decades, the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012
by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

later awarded the Nobel Prize


Two parameters describe the Higgs potential: $m_{H}$ and $v$ (or $\mu$ and
$\lambda$)

Stood up to scrutiny, thus far fulfilling all the predictions made by the SM.

Quantum numbers, Mass measurement

What is not yet tested? (While predicted by the SM)
- Higgs boson coupling to electrons/muons
- Higgs boson coupling to charm- and lighter quarks
- Trilinear self-coupling


Couplings: Z, W, top, bottom, tau, muon (evidence)

This thesis is structured as follows: \Cref{sec:standard_model} lays the
foundation for searches for Higgs boson pair production. The SM is summarised,
and the role of electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs boson in the SM is
illustrated. Moreover, the phenomenology of the Higgs boson and Higgs boson pair
production is discussed in the context of the SM and theories beyond the SM. The
chapter concludes with a summary of experimental results on searches for Higgs
boson pair production prior to the work presented in this thesis.
\Cref{sec:atlas_and_lhc} describes the Large Hadron Collider, the ATLAS
experiment, and the techniques used to reconstruct particle collision events
with the ATLAS detector. The collision events recorded by the ATLAS detector are
analysed using a suite of statistical methods that are introduced in
\Cref{sec:experimental_methods}.

The main part of this thesis is concerned with searches for Higgs boson pair
production in final states with two $b$-quarks and two hadronically decaying
\tauleptons ($\tau^{-} \to \text{hadrons} + \nu_\tau$). A crucial element of
these searches is the ability to reconstruct and identify hadronic \taulepton
decays.\todo{Why?} A novel method of performing \tauid using neural networks is
introduced in \Cref{sec:tauid}. This method is subsequently used in
\Cref{sec:dihiggs} to perform searches for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson
pair production using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of proton--proton collision data
collected at the ATLAS experiment during Run~2 of the Large Hadron Collider. In
\Cref{sec:higgs_self_coupling} the results of \Cref{sec:dihiggs} are
re-interpreted to set constraints on the possible values of the strength of the
Higgs boson self-coupling. The thesis is concluded in \Cref{sec:conclusion}.

Notes from chat with Jochen:
\begin{itemize}

\item Keep it short \ra about 120 pages
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SM about 15 pages and focus on \HH production

  \item LHC and ATLAS experiment about 10 pages: For every detector
    component a picture and a paragraph

  \item Experimental methods: 10 pages

  \item Try to keep it way below 160 pages???
  \end{itemize}

\item Cut out or move less interesting things to the backup

\item Make it more interesting! Cut out repetition...

\end{itemize}
