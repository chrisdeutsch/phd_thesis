I am in a incredibly privileged position to be able to write these words. These
acknowledgements are dedicated to the many people that made this thesis
possible.

extend my gratitude also to those not listed...

First of all, I am indebted to Prof.\ Dr.\ Jochen Dingfelder for accepting me as
part of his research group and giving me the freedom to pursue many interesting
topics during my PhD. I am grateful for your guidance, support, and patience
throughout my MSc and PhD studies in your group. \emph{Thank you!}

I would also like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor Tatjana
Lenz. Thank you for supporting me during my studies and for the many occassions
where you proofread the things I wrote, be it abstracts, internal notes, or
chapters of this thesis. Thank you also for coordinating the \bbtautau effort in
ATLAS, which, I am sure, must have felt like herding cats at times.

Many thanks to Prof.\ Dr.\ Ian Brock for accepting to be a referee for my
dissertation. Moreover, I am grateful to PD Dr.\ Bastian Kubis and Prof.\ Dr.\
Elena Demidova for agreeing to be members of my doctoral committee.

My appreciation goes out to the members and alumni of the \textsc{HEP1}
group. Thank you Shubham Bansal, Florian Beisiegel, Christina Dimitriadi,
Stephan Duell, Peter Falke, Stephan Hageböck, Christian Nass, Oğul Öncel,
Jonathan Pampel, Christos Vergis, and Eckhard von Törne for the lunches, coffee
breaks, and fruitful discussion. It was a pleasure to be able to work alongside
you all. I am thankful to Shubham, Christina, Peter, Christian, and Eckhard for
proofreading parts of this thesis.

Special thanks goes to Benedict Winter, Will Davey, Michel Janus, and
Pier-Olivier DeViveiros for taking me under their wings during the early stages
of my career in the ATLAS collaboration. I appreciate your valuable advice and
infectious enthusiasm, which was a big part in motivating me to continue on the
academic track.

I would like to acknowledge my collaborators at the ATLAS experiment: Alessandra
Betti, Christian Grefe, Zhiyuan ``Jordan'' Li, Yanlin Liu, Max Märker, Bertrand
Martin Dit Latour, Tulin Mete, Giacinto Piacquadio, Elliot Reynolds, Soshi
Tsuno, Song-Ming Wang, Daniele Zanzi, and Bowen Zhang. Many thanks also to my
\bbtautau friends Petar Bokan, Christina Dimitriadi, and Serhat Ördek for the
post-work Zoom hangouts during the pandemic and introducing me to the art of
crab walking.

Lastly, I want to thank my parents. None of this would have been possible
without your support. Many thanks to Hilda for keeping me sane while writing
this thesis.
