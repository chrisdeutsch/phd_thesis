First of all, I am indebted to Prof.\ Dr.\ Jochen Dingfelder for accepting me as
part of his research group and giving me the freedom to pursue many interesting
topics during my PhD. I am grateful for your support and guidance throughout my
MSc and PhD studies in your group. Thank you!

I would like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor Tatjana Lenz. Thank you
for the advice and support you gave me during my studies. Thank you also for
coordinating the \bbtautau effort, which must have felt like herding cats at
times.

Many thanks to Prof.\ Dr.\ Ian Brock for accepting to be a referee for my
dissertation. Moreover, I am grateful to PD Dr.\ Bastian Kubis and Prof.\ Dr.\
Elena Demidova for agreeing to be members of my doctoral committee.

Special thanks goes to Benedict Winter, Will Davey, Michel Janus, and
Pier-Olivier Deviveiros for taking me under their wings during the early stages
of my career in the ATLAS collaboration. I appreciate your valuable advice and
infectious enthusiasm, which was a big part in motivating me to continue on the
academic track.

I would like to acknowledge my collaborators at the ATLAS experiment: Alessandra
Betti, Christian Grefe, Zhiyuan ``Jordan'' Li, Yanlin Liu, Max Märker, Bertrand
Martin Dit Latour, Tulin Mete, Giacinto Piacquadio, Elliot Reynolds, Soshi
Tsuno, Song-Ming Wang, Daniele Zanzi, and Bowen Zhang. Many thanks also to my
\bbtautau-friends Petar Bokan, Christina Dimitriadi, and Serhat Ördek.

I want to thank my parents, without whom none of this would have been
possible. And lastly, thanks to Hilda for keeping me (sort of) sane while
writing this thesis.
