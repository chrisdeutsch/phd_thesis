The following gives an introduction into the techniques used for the
statistical analysis. Statistical inference is used to extract useful
information from measurement results and to test competing hypotheses.


\subsection{The Method of Maximum Likelihood}

\todo[inline]{Need to be careful about continous and discrete random
  variables here. In the end a mixture of continuous and discrete
  observables is used.}

Let~$f(\mathbf{x}; \boldtheta)$ be the joint density (or
probability in the discrete case) of the vector of random
variables~$\mathbf{X}$ that is specified by
parameters~$\boldtheta$. For a given
observation~$\mathbf{x}_\text{obs}$\todo{sample? How does $n$ for
  asymptotics get in here?} of the random variables~$\mathbf{X}$ one
can consider the joint density at the observed point as a function of
the parameter vector~$\boldtheta$
\begin{align*}
  L(\boldtheta) = f(\mathbf{x}_\text{obs}; \boldtheta)
\end{align*}
which is called the likelihood function. The parameters~$\boldtheta$
of the joint distribution~$f(\mathbf{x}; \boldtheta)$ can be inferred
by the use of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by
\begin{align*}
  \hat{\boldtheta} = \argmax_{\boldtheta} L(\boldtheta)
\end{align*}
where~$\hat{\boldtheta}$ is an estimator of the parameters based on
the observed values of~$\mathbf{X}$, i.e.\ the estimator is chosen
such that the density / probability of
observing~$\mathbf{x}_\text{obs}$ is maximized. The maximum likelihood
estimate has the following asymptotic properties~\cite{cramer1999}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unbiased -- $\hat{\boldtheta}$ converges to the true
  value~$\boldtheta$
\item Normal --
\item Efficient -- estimator has minimum variance in the large sample limit
\end{enumerate}

Frequently one minimises the negative logarithm of the likelihood
(NLL) instead, which being a monotonic transformation does not change
the parameter values extremum, to convert the products / exponentials
frequently appearing in the liklihood function into sums / factors.


The probability density function~$f$ is frequently intractable
analytically but can be estimated using Monte Carlo
simulation. Therefore, one can discretise the the observable of
interest into~$k$~bins such that the probability for an event to fall
into bin~$i$ can be described by
\begin{align*}
  p_i(\boldtheta) = \int_\text{bin} f(x; \boldtheta) \, \mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
or using frequentist methods when only MC simulation is available. In
the case of the binned distribution, the likelihood function for a
fixed sample of size~$n$ is given by the probability mass function of
the multinomial distribution
\begin{align*}
  L(\boldtheta) = \frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^k n_i!} \prod_{i = 1}^k \left[ p_i(\boldtheta) \right]^{n_i}
\end{align*}
where~$n_i$ corresponds to the number of observations in bin~$i$ with
the condition that
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i = 1}^k n_i = n \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i = 1}^k p_i(\boldtheta) = 1 \,\text{.}
\end{align*}

In high energy physics, the size of the collected dataset is not fixed
a priori but is varying according to a Poisson distribution with an
expected rate~$\nu$. This is accounted for in the so-called ``extended
likelihood function''~\cite{cowan1998}:
\begin{align*}
  L(\nu, \boldtheta) =
  \frac{\nu^n e^{-\nu}}{n!} \times \frac{n!}
  {\prod_{i = 1}^k n_{i}!}
  \prod_{i = 1}^k \left[ p_i(\boldtheta) \right]^{n_i}
\end{align*}
which follows from the joint distribution given by the product of the
Poisson and multinomial probability mass functions.  With the
expectation value of the number of events in bin~$i$ given
by~$\nu_i(\boldtheta) = \nu p_i(\boldtheta)$\todo{Can $\nu$ depend on
  \boldtheta? In principle it can and should!?} and the previously
mentioned conditions it follows that
\begin{align*}
  L(\nu_1, \dots, \nu_k, \boldtheta) = \prod_{i = 1}^k \frac{\nu_i^{n_i} e^{-\nu_i}}{n_i!}
\end{align*}
which is the product of Poisson probabilities of observing~$n_i$
events in a bin with an expected number of events~$\nu_i$ (the
dependency on \boldtheta is omitted).

% The Poisson part gives the probability of observing~$n$ events while
% the multinomial describes the probability of distributing these events
% among~$k$ bins. In general~$\nu_i$ can depend on~\boldtheta.

In general we are interested in mixture models, where events can
originate from different processes and the observable, which is called
the discriminant in this context as it aims to distinguish betwen the
different parts of the mixture, follows a process-specific
distribution. For illustration consider two species of events, one
from a signal process with PDF $f_\text{S}(x; \boldtheta)$ and from a
background process with PDF $f_\text{B}(x; \boldtheta)$. Consider a
model where the signal process contributes with a fraction~$\alpha$
such that the PDF of the mixture is:
\begin{align*}
  f(x; \mu, \boldtheta) = \alpha f_\text{S}(x; \boldtheta) + (1 - \alpha) f_\text{B}(x; \boldtheta) \,\text{.}
\end{align*}
In practice~$f_\text{B}$ is frequently itself a mixture model
consisting of multiple background processes. In the binned
representation this mixture model yields:
\begin{align*}
  \nu_i(\mu, \boldtheta) = \mu \nu_i^\text{S}(\boldtheta) + \nu_i^\text{B}(\boldtheta)
\end{align*}
with the signal strength~$\mu$ being a parameter of the model, which
is frequently expressed as the cross section of the signal process
with respect to a baseline value like the SM expectation.

The parameter~$\mu$ of the mixture model is usually the parameter of
interest (POI) while the other parameters~\boldtheta, which need to be
determined to estimate the signal strength, are called nuisance
parameters.

\todo[inline]{Maybe stress that at this point it's a particular choice
  model?}

The binned / extended likelihood function is further extended by
incorporating multiple analysis channels, additional free parameters
(like the signal strength), systematic uncertainties, and auxiliary
measurements. With a set of analysis channels~$\mathcal{C}$, a set of
bins in a given channel~$\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{C}$, and a set of
auxiliary measurements~$\mathbb{S}$, the likelihood function can be
written as~\cite{cranmer2012}:
\begin{align*}
  L(\boldalpha, \boldphi, \boldgamma) =
  \prod_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \prod_{b \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{C}}}
  \mathrm{Pois}\left( n_{cb} \mid \nu_{cb}(\boldalpha, \boldphi, \boldgamma) \right)
  \mathrm{Pois}\left(m_{cb} \mid  \gamma_{cb} \tau_{cb} \right)
  \prod_{p \in \mathbb{S}} f_p\left(a_p \mid \alpha_p \right)
\end{align*}
Latin letter correspond to observables while greek letters correspond
to nuisance parameters.

\begin{align*}
  \nu_{cb}(\boldalpha, \boldphi, \boldgamma) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} \gamma_{cb} \, \phi_{cs} \, \eta_{cs}(\boldalpha) \, \sigma_{csb}(\boldalpha)
\end{align*}
$\boldalpha = (\alpha_i)_i$, $\boldphi = (\phi_{cs})_{cs}$,
$\boldgamma = (\gamma_{cb})$.

\subsection{Hypothesis Testing}

Hypothesis testing aims to distinguish between a null hypothesis~$H_0$
(e.g.\ the Standard Model) and an alternative hypothesis~$H_1$. The
value of a test statistic~$t(\mathbf{x})$, which is commonly a real
number, serves to indicate agreement with $H_0$ or $H_1$,
respectively. Various methods exist to construct suitable test
statistics.

A rejection region of the test can be defined by setting a threshold
on the test statistic, i.e.\ $t > t_\text{cut}$, which specifies the
significance~$\alpha$ of the test, which is the probability to reject
$H_0$ in favour of $H_1$ if $H_0$ was true (type I error
rate). Moreover, the power of the test, $1 - \beta$, is specified,
which is related to the probability~$\beta$ of accepting $H_1$ when
$H_0$ was true (type II error rate). The field of particle physics
adopts the convention that the null hypothesis needs to be rejected at
a significance level of~$\alpha = \num{2.87e-7}$ ($5\sigma$) to claim
discovery of new phenomena.


Composite hypothesis: hypothesis depending on some parameter, e.g.\
signal strength.


$\boldtheta \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}_0$ (usually a simple hypothesis,
i.e.\ the set has one element)

$\boldtheta \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}_1$ (composite hypothesis)

Nested model: The b-only model is the special case of~$\mu = 0$.



\subsection{Likelihood Ratio Test and Neyman-Pearson Lemma}

The (profile) Likelihood Ratio Test is the optimal test based on the
Neyman-Pearson lemma~\cite{neyman1933} meaning for a given
significance level yielding the largest power.
\begin{align*}
  \Lambda = \frac{L(\boldtheta \mid H_0)}{L(\boldtheta \mid H_1)}
\end{align*}



The likelihood ratio still depends on both the parameters of interest
as well as the nuisance parameters. The profile likelihood given by
\begin{align*}
  L_\text{p}(\mu) = \sup_\theta L(\mu, \theta) % \\
%  \hat{\hat{\theta}}(\mu) = \argmax_\theta \mathcal{L}(\mu, \theta \mid \mathbf{x})
\end{align*}
and represents a profile of the likelihood function along the line
given by~$\hat{\hat{\theta}}(\mu) = \argmax_\theta L(\mu, \theta)$
(sometimes called the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the
nuisance parameters given~$\mu$ -- double hat to distinguish it from
the maximum likelihood estimate~$\hat{\theta}$). The maximum of the
profile likelihood coincides with the maximum likelihood estimate.

Profile likelihood ratio test statistic:
\begin{align*}
  \Lambda(\mu) = \frac{\mathcal{L}\left( \mu, \hat{\hat{\theta}} \mid \mathbf{x} \right)}
                      {\mathcal{L}\left( \hat{\mu}, \hat{\theta} \mid \mathbf{x} \right)}
\end{align*}

hat: estimator to distinguish it from the true value of the parameter.

Asymptotic distributions: Wilk's theorem (valid under some regularity
conditions: asymptotic, nested, either model is correct, identifiable,
i.e.\ any value of parameters is uniquely assigned to a distinct
hypothesis)
