This chapter provides an overview of the statistical methods employed in this
thesis. \Cref{sec:statistical_inference} introduces methods of statistical
inference that are used for the interpretation of the results of
\Cref{sec:dihiggs,sec:higgs_self_coupling}. Moreover,
\Cref{sec:tauid,sec:dihiggs,sec:higgs_self_coupling} employ several machine
learning algorithms which are presented in \Cref{sec:machine_learning}.
