\section{Machine Learning}

Supervised learning, i.e.\ have labelled data.

Binary classification tasks: Every training example has a label indicating the class membership.

In HEP, the positive class is typically referred to as \emph{signal} while the
negative class is referred to as \emph{background}.



\subsection{Boosted Decision Trees}

Boosted decision trees (BDT) are a classification algorithm consisting on an
ensemble of \emph{decision tree classifiers} that are combined to yield a more
powerful classifier. This ensemble of decision trees is created using a
meta-algorithm referred to as \emph{boosting}
