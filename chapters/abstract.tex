This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production in final states
with two $b$-quarks and two \tauleptons using \SI{139}{\per\femto\barn} of
proton--proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{13}{\TeV}
recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015--2018.
Searches for Higgs boson pair production are important to solidify our
understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard~Model and, in
addition, serve as probes for physics beyond the Standard~Model.

The search presented in this thesis targets channels with at least one hadronic
\taulepton decay (i.e.~$\tau \to \nu_{\tau} + \text{hadrons}$). A crucial
component of searches in these channels is the ability to distinguish the
signatures of hadronic \taulepton decays from those of quark- or gluon-initiated
jets in the ATLAS detector. For this purpose, a novel \tauid algorithm based on
recurrent neural networks is introduced. The algorithm exploits information of
reconstructed charged-particle tracks, topological clusters of calorimeter cell
signals, and purposefully constructed discriminating variables. The new \tauid
method significantly outperforms the methods used perviously and has since
become the default algorithm for \tauid at the ATLAS experiment.

Upper limits are set on the signal strength, $\mu$, and the cross section,
$\xsecggfvbf$, at \SI{95}{\percent}~CL. Yielding: $\mu < \num{4.7}$ and
$\xsecggfvbf < \SI{140}{\femto\barn}$.


% Search for SM~\HH production

% No statistically significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is
% observed.


% Search for resonant \HH production.
% - No statistically significant excess is observed.
% - Limits are set for resonance masses ranging from 251 GeV to 1600 GeV
% - The largest excess is at 1 TeV with a local (global) significance of 3.1 (2.0) $\sigma$


% Self coupling:

% The search is reinterpreted in the context of anomalous values of the Higgs
% boson self-coupling constant. The allowed \klambda interval yields
% $-2.4 \leq \klambda \leq 9.2$.

% Tau-ID

% Non-resonant and resonant
%
% Upper limits on the SM HH production cross section

% klambda
