\textbf{Grammatical errors:}
\begin{itemize}

\item 3 occurances of ``with few modifications'' changed to ``with \textbf{a} few
  modifications'' (pp.\ 49, 100, 177)

\item ``The sample of simulated events is normalised using \textbf{an} $\pp \to \HH$
  cross section of \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \dots'' changed to ``The sample of
  simulated events is normalised using \textbf{a} $\pp \to \HH$ cross section of
  \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \dots'' (p.\ 82)

\end{itemize}


\textbf{Edits for clarity:}
\begin{itemize}

\item Minor change in sentence structure for footnote on p.\ 131:

  ``The fraction of events with a misreconstructed $H \to \bbbar$ or
  $H \to \tautau$ candidate, i.e.\ $b$-jet candidates or \tauhadvis not being
  matched to Higgs boson decay products at generator-level, are about
  \SI{2}{\percent} and \SI{0.2}{\percent} \textbf{in SR of the \hadhad channel},
  respectively.'' changed to ``\textbf{In the SR of the \hadhad channel,} the
  fraction of events with a misreconstructed $H \to \bbbar$ or $H \to \tautau$
  candidate, i.e.\ $b$-jet candidates or \tauhadvis not being matched to Higgs
  boson decay products at generator-level, are about \SI{2}{\percent} and
  \SI{0.2}{\percent}, respectively.''

  The intent is to clarify that \SI{2}{\percent} refers to the
  misreconstruction rate of the $H \to \bbbar$ candidate and \SI{0.2}{\percent}
  to the misreconstruction rate of the $H \to \tautau$ candidate.

\item ``The precise measurement of charged-particle tracks is important to
  reconstruct the primary vertex (PV) of the hard interaction with \textbf{high}
  spatial resolution.'' changed to ``The precise measurement of charged-particle
  tracks is important to reconstruct the primary vertex (PV) of the hard
  interaction with \textbf{good} spatial
  resolution.'' (p.\ 33)

  The intent is to remove any potential ambiguity surrounding the term ``high
  spatial resolution''. This clarification is done because the terms ``low'' and
  ``high'' can have varying implications depending on the specific metric used
  to quantify resolution.

\end{itemize}
