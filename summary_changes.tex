% \textbf{Grammatical errors:}
% \begin{itemize}

% \item 3 occurances of ``with few modifications'' changed to ``with \textbf{a} few
%   modifications'' (pp.\ 49, 100, 177)

% \item ``The sample of simulated events is normalised using \textbf{an} $\pp \to \HH$
%   cross section of \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \dots'' changed to ``The sample of
%   simulated events is normalised using \textbf{a} $\pp \to \HH$ cross section of
%   \SI{31.05}{\femto\barn} \dots'' (p.\ 82)

% \end{itemize}


% \textbf{Edits for clarity:}
% \begin{itemize}

% \item Minor change in sentence structure for footnote on p.\ 131:

%   ``The fraction of events with a misreconstructed $H \to \bbbar$ or
%   $H \to \tautau$ candidate, i.e.\ $b$-jet candidates or \tauhadvis not being
%   matched to Higgs boson decay products at generator-level, are about
%   \SI{2}{\percent} and \SI{0.2}{\percent} \textbf{in SR of the \hadhad channel},
%   respectively.'' changed to ``\textbf{In the SR of the \hadhad channel,} the
%   fraction of events with a misreconstructed $H \to \bbbar$ or $H \to \tautau$
%   candidate, i.e.\ $b$-jet candidates or \tauhadvis not being matched to Higgs
%   boson decay products at generator-level, are about \SI{2}{\percent} and
%   \SI{0.2}{\percent}, respectively.''

%   The intent is to clarify that \SI{2}{\percent} refers to the
%   misreconstruction rate of the $H \to \bbbar$ candidate and \SI{0.2}{\percent}
%   to the misreconstruction rate of the $H \to \tautau$ candidate.

% \item ``The precise measurement of charged-particle tracks is important to
%   reconstruct the primary vertex (PV) of the hard interaction with \textbf{high}
%   spatial resolution.'' changed to ``The precise measurement of charged-particle
%   tracks is important to reconstruct the primary vertex (PV) of the hard
%   interaction with \textbf{good} spatial
%   resolution.'' (p.\ 33)

%   The intent is to remove any potential ambiguity surrounding the term ``high
%   spatial resolution''. This clarification is done because the terms ``low'' and
%   ``high'' can have varying implications depending on the specific metric used
%   to quantify resolution.

% TODO: pt jet seed in Tau-ID

% TODO: Why ggF xsec uncertainty asymmetric?

% TODO: Why VBF xsec uncertainty so small?

% TODO: ROC-AUC values seem high for the plot. Answer: The ROC-AUC cannot be
% read off this plot that easily (only a crude approximation after further
% computation). Also the y-axis is given in log-scale which might suggest that
% there is more overlap between background & signal than there actually is.
